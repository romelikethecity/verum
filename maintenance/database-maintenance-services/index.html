        <h2>Your Team Has Better Things to Do</h2>

        <p>Database maintenance is important. Everyone knows that. But when it comes time to actually do it, there's always something more urgent. A deal to close. A campaign to launch. A fire to put out.</p>

        <p>So the database work gets pushed. And pushed. And pushed again. Until someone runs a campaign against stale data, bounces 40% of their emails, and suddenly data quality is an emergency.</p>

        <p>Full-service database maintenance means it just happens. We handle validation, enrichment, deduplication, and monitoring on a continuous basis. Your team doesn't think about data quality because they don't have to.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"I used to spend 10 hours a week on data cleanup. Now I spend zero. The data just stays clean. It's like having a data ops person who actually does the work."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Marketing Operations Manager</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What's Included</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Weekly validation scans.</strong> Every active record checked against email, phone, and business status databases. Problems flagged immediately.</li>

          <li><strong>Monthly enrichment passes.</strong> Attempt to fill gaps in incomplete records. New data sources mean new opportunities to complete profiles.</li>

          <li><strong>Quarterly deep cleans.</strong> Full database audit including deduplication, standardization, and comprehensive re-validation.</li>

          <li><strong>New record processing.</strong> Every record that enters your database gets validated and enriched before your team touches it.</li>

          <li><strong>Change monitoring.</strong> Track when contacts change jobs, companies get acquired, or businesses close. Know before your outreach fails.</li>

          <li><strong>Monthly reporting.</strong> Clear metrics on database health, what changed, and what needs attention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Connect your data.</strong> We set up a connection to your CRM or data warehouse. Most clients do monthly exports; we can also do direct API connections.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Baseline assessment.</strong> We audit your current database and establish quality metrics. You'll know exactly where you stand.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Initial cleanup.</strong> We fix existing problems—validation, deduplication, enrichment. Your database starts from a clean baseline.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Ongoing maintenance.</strong> Weekly scans, monthly enrichment, quarterly deep cleans. All handled by us.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Continuous improvement.</strong> As we learn your data patterns, we refine our processes. Quality improves over time.</p>

        <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

        <p><strong>Sales ops teams</strong> who are tired of playing whack-a-mole with data quality issues.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing operations</strong> who need reliable data for campaigns without dedicating headcount to maintenance.</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue operations</strong> who want to build systems on data they can trust.</p>

        <p><strong>Growing companies</strong> who know they need data governance but don't have bandwidth to build it internally.</p>

        <h2>What You Don't Have to Do</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Run manual validation checks</li>
          <li>Hunt for enrichment sources</li>
          <li>Build deduplication logic</li>
          <li>Create monitoring dashboards</li>
          <li>Schedule quarterly cleanup projects</li>
          <li>Explain to sales why the data is bad</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do all of it. You get clean data.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Full-service maintenance is priced based on database size and update frequency:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Under 25,000 records:</strong> Starting at $1,500/month</li>
          <li><strong>25,000-100,000 records:</strong> Starting at $2,500/month</li>
          <li><strong>100,000+ records:</strong> Custom pricing based on scope</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Includes initial cleanup, weekly validation, monthly enrichment, quarterly deep cleans, and monthly reporting.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Do we need to commit to a long contract?</h3>
          <p>We ask for a 3-month minimum to get through initial cleanup and establish processes. After that, month-to-month with 30-day notice.</p>

          <h3>Can you work with any CRM?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, Pipedrive, or anything that can export data. We've worked with dozens of systems.</p>

          <h3>What about custom fields and data models?</h3>
          <p>We adapt to your schema. If you have custom fields that need validation or enrichment, we'll include them in our processes.</p>

          <h3>How do updates get back into our CRM?</h3>
          <p>Your choice. We can deliver updated files for your team to import, or configure direct updates through your CRM's API with your approval workflows.</p>

          <h3>What if we already have pretty clean data?</h3>
          <p>Then maintenance is easier and cheaper. Our pricing scales with effort required, not just record count.</p>
