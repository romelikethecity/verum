        <h2>Your CRM Is Getting Worse Every Day</h2>

        <p>Every month, 2-3% of your CRM data decays. Contacts change jobs. Companies get acquired. Phone numbers get reassigned. Email addresses bounce.</p>

        <p>That's 25-30% per year. A quarter of your database becoming useless while your team keeps working it like nothing's wrong.</p>

        <p>The result? Bounced emails hurt your sender reputation. Wasted calls frustrate your SDRs. Bad data flows into reports and forecasts. Trust in the CRM erodes until reps start keeping their own spreadsheets.</p>

        <p>CRM maintenance stops the decay. We validate, clean, and enrich your CRM data on an ongoing basis so it stays accurate without manual effort from your team.</p>

          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our Salesforce had 80,000 contacts. We knew maybe half were still good, but nobody had time to figure out which half. Now we know—and the database stays clean automatically."</blockquote>

        <h2>CRMs We Support</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Salesforce.</strong> Native integration via API or Data Loader exports. Works with any edition.</li>

          <li><strong>HubSpot.</strong> Direct integration or export/import workflows. Full support for custom properties.</li>

          <li><strong>Microsoft Dynamics.</strong> Integration via API or Excel exports. Compatible with all versions.</li>

          <li><strong>Pipedrive.</strong> API integration or CSV workflows for smaller databases.</li>

          <li><strong>Zoho CRM.</strong> Export/import workflows with full field mapping support.</li>

          <li><strong>Other CRMs.</strong> If it can export and import data, we can maintain it. We've worked with dozens of platforms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Gets Maintained</h2>

        <p><strong>Contact records:</strong> Email validation, phone verification, job title updates, company changes.</p>

        <p><strong>Account records:</strong> Business status checks, address standardization, firmographic updates, duplicate detection.</p>

        <p><strong>Lead records:</strong> Pre-qualification validation, enrichment before routing, duplicate checking against existing contacts.</p>

        <p><strong>Custom objects:</strong> We can maintain any object type if you have validation or enrichment needs for it.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Connect.</strong> We set up a data connection—either scheduled exports from your CRM or direct API access with read/write permissions.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Map.</strong> We map your fields to our validation and enrichment processes. Custom fields included.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Process.</strong> Weekly validation scans, monthly enrichment passes, quarterly deep cleans. All automated.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Update.</strong> Clean data gets written back to your CRM. You choose: automatic updates or approve-then-import.</p>

        <h2>Maintenance Cadence Options</h2>

        <p><strong>Weekly validation:</strong> Email deliverability and phone connectivity checks on active records. Problems flagged immediately.</p>

        <p><strong>Monthly enrichment:</strong> Attempt to fill gaps in incomplete records. Add missing firmographic data, update stale fields.</p>

        <p><strong>Quarterly deep clean:</strong> Full database validation, deduplication pass, comprehensive enrichment refresh, health report.</p>

        <p>Most clients run weekly validation + monthly enrichment + quarterly deep cleans. High-velocity teams sometimes want daily monitoring.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Validated data.</strong> Emails verified, phones checked, businesses confirmed as operating.</li>

          <li><strong>Enriched records.</strong> Gaps filled with firmographic, technographic, and contact data.</li>

          <li><strong>Deduplicated database.</strong> Merge candidates identified and resolved (with your approval).</li>

          <li><strong>Monthly reports.</strong> Clear metrics on database health, decay rate, and improvement over time.</li>

          <li><strong>Zero manual work.</strong> We handle everything. Your team just uses clean data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Will this break our CRM workflows?</h3>
          <p>No. We work within your existing data model and respect your validation rules. Updates go through your normal processes—we're just providing cleaner data.</p>

          <h3>What about records we don't want touched?</h3>
          <p>We can exclude any records you specify—by owner, status, custom field, or any other criteria. You control what gets maintained.</p>

          <h3>Do you need admin access to our CRM?</h3>
          <p>Depends on the integration method. For file-based workflows, no. For API integrations, we need appropriate read/write permissions on the objects we're maintaining.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle duplicates?</h3>
          <p>We identify merge candidates but don't auto-merge without approval. You get a list of recommended merges with match confidence scores.</p>

          <h3>What about our marketing automation platform?</h3>
          <p>If it syncs with your CRM, clean CRM data means clean marketing data. We can also maintain marketing platforms directly if needed.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Keep Your CRM Actually Useful</h2>

        <p>A CRM full of bad data isn't a CRM—it's a liability. Ongoing maintenance keeps your data accurate so your team can trust what they see and act on it with confidence.</p>
