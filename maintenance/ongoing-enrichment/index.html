        <h2>One-Time Enrichment Isn't Enough</h2>

        <p>You enriched your database. It was a good project. Fill rates improved. But that was six months ago.</p>

        <p>Since then, your database has grown. New leads came in incomplete. New accounts got added without firmographic data. That contact you couldn't find a phone number for? Maybe it's available now. But you're not checking.</p>

        <p>One-time enrichment is a snapshot. Ongoing enrichment is continuous improvement. Every month, we attempt to fill gaps that couldn't be filled before. New data sources come online. Companies update their information. What was unfindable becomes findable.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Six months ago, we couldn't find direct dials for 40% of our target contacts. Now we have them for 75%. Same contacts—the data just became available and ongoing enrichment caught it."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Sales Development Manager</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What Ongoing Enrichment Fills</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Contact information.</strong> Email addresses, phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles. Re-attempt missing data monthly.</li>

          <li><strong>Firmographic data.</strong> Employee count, revenue, industry classification, company type. Fill gaps and update stale values.</li>

          <li><strong>Technographic data.</strong> Tech stack, tools used, platforms. New installations get detected.</li>

          <li><strong>Company details.</strong> Headquarters location, founding year, social profiles, description.</li>

          <li><strong>Job details.</strong> Updated titles, seniority level, department, reporting structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Initial gap analysis.</strong> We assess your database to understand what's missing. Which fields are most incomplete? Which records have the biggest gaps?</p>

        <p><strong>Monthly enrichment passes.</strong> Every month, we attempt to fill gaps using 50+ data sources. New records get enriched immediately. Existing incomplete records get re-attempted.</p>

        <p><strong>Source cycling.</strong> Different data sources have different coverage. We cycle through sources, so data unavailable from one might be found through another.</p>

        <p><strong>Quality validation.</strong> New data gets validated before delivery. No point filling a gap with bad data.</p>

        <h2>Why Ongoing Beats One-Time</h2>

        <p><strong>New records need enrichment too.</strong> Your database isn't static. New leads and accounts arrive constantly. Ongoing enrichment catches them immediately.</p>

        <p><strong>Data availability changes.</strong> A contact who wasn't findable last month might be findable this month. Companies publish more information. People join LinkedIn. Databases update.</p>

        <p><strong>Sources improve.</strong> Data providers add coverage constantly. A company not in ZoomInfo might be in Apollo. What wasn't available anywhere might be available somewhere now.</p>

        <p><strong>Cumulative improvement.</strong> Each pass fills some gaps. Over time, fill rates compound. Records get steadily more complete.</p>

        <h2>Enrichment Cadence Options</h2>

        <p><strong>Monthly:</strong> Standard cadence. Good balance of coverage and cost. Most clients choose this.</p>

        <p><strong>Weekly:</strong> For high-velocity teams who need fresh data constantly. New records enriched within a week.</p>

        <p><strong>Real-time:</strong> Instant enrichment on new record creation. API integration with your CRM or data pipeline.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Integration with Other Maintenance</h2>

        <p>Ongoing enrichment works best combined with other maintenance services:</p>

        <p><strong>With validation:</strong> We validate what we enrich. No point adding a phone number that doesn't work.</p>

        <p><strong>With decay monitoring:</strong> When contacts change, we re-enrich to get updated information.</p>

        <p><strong>With quarterly cleanup:</strong> Deep enrichment passes quarterly, light maintenance monthly.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Ongoing enrichment is priced based on volume and field depth:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic enrichment (firmographics only):</strong> $0.05-0.10 per record/month</li>
          <li><strong>Standard enrichment (firmographics + contact):</strong> $0.10-0.20 per record/month</li>
          <li><strong>Full enrichment (all fields + technographics):</strong> $0.20-0.40 per record/month</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You only pay for records we attempt to enrich. Inactive or complete records can be excluded.</p>
