        <h2>Data Decay Is Constant and Silent</h2>

        <p>Every day, your B2B database gets a little worse. It's not dramatic—no one wakes up to find half their records gone. It's gradual.</p>

        <p>This week, three contacts left their jobs. Next week, two businesses closed. The week after, five email addresses started bouncing. Week by week, month by month, your database decays at a documented 30% annual rate.</p>

        <p>Most companies don't notice until something breaks. A campaign bounces hard. An SDR wastes a whole day calling dead numbers. The forecast includes accounts that no longer exist.</p>

        <p>Data decay prevention is about catching problems early—before they cascade into operational failures.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We lost our biggest champion at a key account. With decay monitoring, we knew within 48 hours that he'd left—and had his replacement's contact info within a week. Without it, we'd have found out when our renewal went sideways."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Customer Success Manager</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Monitor</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Job changes.</strong> Track when contacts leave their company or change roles. Know immediately when your champion moves.</li>

          <li><strong>Company status.</strong> Monitor for closures, acquisitions, name changes, and restructuring. No more targeting companies that don't exist.</li>

          <li><strong>Email deliverability.</strong> Watch for addresses approaching bounce thresholds, domain issues, and ISP blacklisting.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone connectivity.</strong> Detect disconnected numbers, carrier changes, and reassigned lines before your reps call them.</li>

          <li><strong>Domain health.</strong> Monitor company domains for expiration, ownership changes, and website status.</li>

          <li><strong>Data age.</strong> Flag records that haven't been validated in 6+ months. Old data is risky data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Early Warning System</h2>

        <p>Decay prevention isn't just validation—it's prediction. We look for signals that decay is coming before it arrives.</p>

        <p><strong>Soft bounce patterns:</strong> Email addresses that soft-bounce repeatedly often hard-bounce soon. We flag them early.</p>

        <p><strong>LinkedIn activity:</strong> Contacts posting about new roles or updating profiles often precede official changes.</p>

        <p><strong>Company signals:</strong> Funding rounds, layoffs, acquisitions, and leadership changes predict database churn.</p>

        <p><strong>Tenure analysis:</strong> Contacts in roles for 2+ years are statistically more likely to change soon. We prioritize their monitoring.</p>

        <h2>How Decay Prevention Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Initial assessment.</strong> We analyze your database to understand decay risk by segment. Some records need daily monitoring; others are fine monthly.</p>

        <p><strong>Continuous monitoring.</strong> High-risk records get checked frequently. Lower-risk records get periodic validation. Resources focus where decay is most likely.</p>

        <p><strong>Alerts and reports.</strong> When we detect decay or decay signals, you get notified immediately. Weekly summaries show trends and predicted problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Remediation options.</strong> For each decayed record, we provide options: updated contact info, replacement contacts, or recommended actions.</p>

        <h2>Decay Risk Factors</h2>

        <p>Not all records decay at the same rate. We prioritize monitoring based on risk factors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Tech and startup contacts churn faster than manufacturing or government.</li>
          <li><strong>Role level:</strong> C-level and VP contacts change more often than individual contributors.</li>
          <li><strong>Company stage:</strong> Early-stage and recently-funded companies have higher turnover.</li>
          <li><strong>Data age:</strong> Records over 12 months old are significantly more likely to be stale.</li>
          <li><strong>Validation history:</strong> Records that have decayed before often decay again.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Real-time alerts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact left company</li>
          <li>Email started bouncing</li>
          <li>Business status changed</li>
          <li>Phone disconnected</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Records that decayed this week</li>
          <li>High-risk records to watch</li>
          <li>Decay rate by segment</li>
          <li>Trend analysis vs. previous weeks</li>

          <li>Updated company information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Decay prevention is priced based on monitoring intensity:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic monitoring:</strong> Monthly checks on all records, weekly on high-risk. $0.02-0.05 per record/month.</li>
          <li><strong>Standard monitoring:</strong> Weekly checks on all records, daily on high-risk. $0.05-0.10 per record/month.</li>
          <li><strong>Premium monitoring:</strong> Daily checks plus job change tracking and company signals. $0.10-0.20 per record/month.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Volume discounts apply. Most clients monitor 10,000-50,000 records.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How is this different from regular validation?</h3>
          <p>Validation checks if data is currently good. Decay prevention monitors for change over time and predicts future problems. Validation is a snapshot; decay prevention is surveillance.</p>

          <h3>Can you replace contacts who leave?</h3>
          <p>Yes. When we detect a contact departure, we can research their replacement. This is optional—some clients want the data, others want us to find replacements automatically.</p>

          <h3>What about GDPR and privacy?</h3>
          <p>We only monitor business contact information using publicly available sources. No scraping personal data or violating privacy regulations.</p>

          <h3>How quickly do you detect job changes?</h3>
          <p>Depends on the source. LinkedIn changes are often caught within 48-72 hours. Email bounces are immediate. Some changes take longer to surface in public sources.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Stay Ahead of Decay</h2>

        <p>Data decay is inevitable. Surprise is optional. Proactive monitoring catches problems early so you can fix them before they cost you deals.</p>
