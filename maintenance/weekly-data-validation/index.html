        <h2>Problems Don't Wait for Annual Cleanups</h2>

        <p>Every week, something changes in your database. Someone leaves their job. A business closes. An email address starts bouncing. A phone number gets reassigned.</p>

        <p>If you only validate annually, you're working bad data for months before you know it's bad. Your SDRs waste calls on disconnected numbers. Your marketing campaigns bounce. Your sender reputation slowly erodes.</p>

        <p>Weekly validation catches problems when they're fresh. An email that bounced Monday gets flagged Tuesday—not discovered six months later when you run your annual cleanup.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We used to bounce 5-8% of our outreach emails. After switching to weekly validation, we're consistently under 1%. Our deliverability is the best it's ever been."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Email Marketing Manager</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Validate Weekly</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Email deliverability.</strong> Check against major ISP bounce lists, catch newly invalid addresses, identify risky domains before you send.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone connectivity.</strong> Verify numbers are still connected, detect reassigned lines, flag numbers that switched carriers.</li>

          <li><strong>Business status.</strong> Monitor for closures, name changes, and acquisitions. Know when a prospect company no longer exists.</li>

          <li><strong>New record validation.</strong> Every record added to your database gets validated before anyone works it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Weekly Validation Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Monday: Data pull.</strong> We receive your latest data—either via scheduled export or API sync.</p>

        <p><strong>Tuesday: Validation scan.</strong> Every active record checked against validation databases. Email, phone, business status.</p>

        <p><strong>Wednesday: Results delivered.</strong> You get a report of what changed: newly invalid emails, disconnected phones, closed businesses.</p>

        <p><strong>Thursday-Friday: Your choice.</strong> Either we update records automatically, or your team reviews and approves changes.</p>

        <p>By the next Monday, your database reflects current reality. No surprises, no stale data sitting for months.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Weekly validation report:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Records validated this week</li>
          <li>New invalids discovered</li>
          <li>Records recovered (previously invalid, now valid)</li>
          <li>Business status changes</li>
          <li>Recommended actions</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Updated database file</strong> (or direct CRM updates):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Validation status field updated</li>
          <li>Validation date stamped</li>
          <li>Reason codes for invalids</li>
          <li>Confidence scores for edge cases</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Weekly Beats Monthly (or Annual)</h2>

        <p><strong>Faster problem detection.</strong> An email that goes bad Monday gets caught Tuesday, not next month.</p>

        <p><strong>Smaller batches.</strong> Fixing 50 records a week is manageable. Fixing 2,500 records at year-end is a project.</p>

        <p><strong>Better sender reputation.</strong> Email providers track your bounce rate over time. Consistent low bounces beat occasional spikes.</p>

        <p><strong>Happier sales team.</strong> Reps learn to trust the data because it's consistently accurate, not just accurate after cleanups.</p>

        <h2>Scope Options</h2>

        <p><strong>Active records only:</strong> Just validate records your team is actively working—leads in sequence, accounts in territory, opportunities in pipeline. Lower cost, focused impact.</p>

        <p><strong>Full database:</strong> Validate everything, including dormant records. More comprehensive, catches problems in re-engagement campaigns.</p>

        <p><strong>New records plus sample:</strong> Validate all new records, plus a rotating sample of existing records. Good balance of coverage and cost.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Weekly validation is priced per record validated:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email validation:</strong> $0.02-0.05 per record</li>
          <li><strong>Phone validation:</strong> $0.03-0.08 per record</li>
          <li><strong>Business status:</strong> $0.05-0.10 per record</li>
          <li><strong>Bundle (all three):</strong> $0.08-0.15 per record</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Volume discounts available. Most clients validate 5,000-50,000 records weekly.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">

          <p>Depends on your velocity. High-volume outbound teams benefit most. If you're only sending 500 emails a month, monthly validation might suffice.</p>

        <h2>Stop Discovering Bad Data the Hard Way</h2>

        <p>Every bounced email and disconnected call is a problem you could have prevented. Weekly validation catches issues before they impact your outreach.</p>
