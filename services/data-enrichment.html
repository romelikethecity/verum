        <h2>What Data Enrichment Actually Looks Like</h2>

        <p>A data protection company came to us with 50,000 accounts. Seventeen years of accumulated records. The database had been through multiple acquisitions, countless sales reps, and more than a few "we'll clean this up later" decisions that never happened.</p>

        <p>Industry classifications? Missing for thousands of accounts. Employee counts? Gone for nearly 10% of the database. Revenue data was inconsistent. Some records in thousands, some in millions, some just blank.</p>

        <p>But the real problem was hidden in plain sight.</p>

        <p>They had 703 MSP accounts buried in generic "Partner" categories. For a data protection company, managed service providers aren't just customers. They're force multipliers. One MSP can deploy your solution across dozens or hundreds of end clients. And this company had no idea these accounts existed.</p>

        <p>They couldn't tell partners from end customers from distributors. They had 305 subsidiaries hiding across 122 parent companies. Sales reps were accidentally pitching different divisions of the same organization.</p>

        <p>No technology stack data. No visibility into what tools prospects were using or what competitors they might be replacing.</p>

        <h3>What we delivered</h3>

        <p>We enriched 1,189 accounts with full firmographic data. 98.6% industry classification coverage. 91.8% employee count coverage. A 108% increase in total data points per account.</p>

        <p>Those 703 MSPs? Surfaced and properly classified. We mapped 305 subsidiaries to 122 parent companies so their sales team could finally see organizational relationships.</p>

        <p>For contacts, we found 525 LinkedIn profiles to verify current employment. Caught 195 job changes. Nearly 20% of their contact database was pointing at people who'd left months or years ago.</p>

        <h3>The results</h3>

        <p>Sales reps were spending 30-45 minutes per account on manual research. With 1,189 enriched accounts, that's 600-900 hours recovered. At $75-100/hour for a fully-loaded AE, that's $45,000-$90,000 in labor costs saved.</p>

        <p>Those 703 MSPs? If the average MSP deal is $25K annually and they convert just 5%, that's 35 new deals. $875,000 in new annual recurring revenue from accounts that were already in their CRM.</p>

        <p>Sales cycle length dropped 15-20% for properly-enriched accounts. When reps walk into conversations knowing the prospect's tech stack, their organizational structure, and who actually makes decisions, deals move faster.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <h3>Contact-Level Data</h3>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified email addresses.</strong> Not just syntactically valid. Actually deliverable. We check against bounce lists, catch-all domains, and known bad actors.</li>

          <li><strong>Direct dial phone numbers.</strong> Main office lines are useless for reaching decision-makers. We find direct numbers that actually get answered.</li>

          <li><strong>Mobile numbers.</strong> When you need to reach someone and their desk phone goes to voicemail.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn profiles.</strong> Verified and current. We catch when someone's profile shows "Former" for a company they haven't worked at in years.</li>

          <li><strong>Job title and seniority.</strong> Standardized so your segmentation actually works. "VP of Sales" and "Vice President, Sales" become the same category.</li>

          <li><strong>Job start date.</strong> Know who's new in role. New executives often mean new vendor evaluations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Company-Level Data</h3>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Standardized codes that match your segmentation model. Not free-text descriptions that vary by who entered the record.</li>

          <li><strong>Employee count.</strong> Current headcount, not the number from when they were founded. Validated against multiple sources.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue range.</strong> Annual revenue bands for prioritization and routing. We use multiple signals when public data isn't available.</li>

          <li><strong>Headquarters location.</strong> Legal headquarters versus operational locations. Important for territory assignment and compliance.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use today. Cloud providers, development frameworks, business applications. Walk into conversations knowing what you're complementing or replacing.</li>

          <li><strong>Funding data.</strong> Last round, amount raised, key investors. Signals for growth trajectory and budget availability.</li>

          <li><strong>Parent/subsidiary relationships.</strong> Know when you're talking to a division versus the corporate entity. Stop looking foolish pitching companies that are already customers under a different name.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Enrichment by Industry</h2>

        <p>Different industries need different enrichment. Healthcare requires NPI validation and credentialing data. Technology companies need technographic signals and funding history. Professional services firms care about practice areas and partner relationships.</p>

        <p>We've enriched data for companies across these industries:</p>

        <p class="mt-lg">Don't see your industry? <a href="/#contact">Contact us</a>—we've likely worked with similar enrichment needs.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Marketo, or send us Excel/CSV/Google Sheets. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and identify gaps.</strong> Before we enrich anything, you'll see exactly what's missing and what we can fill. Match rate estimates by field. No surprises.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from LinkedIn, company websites, SEC filings, press releases, job postings, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Parent companies that share names with unrelated businesses. Executives who have common names. We verify before we ship.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: You get enriched data back.</strong> Same format you sent, or direct CRM push. Your choice.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Data enrichment runs $0.10-0.50 per record, depending on which fields you need and the complexity of the data. Full firmographic and contact enrichment is at the higher end. Single-field enrichment (just phone numbers, just industry codes) is lower.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data. No surprises, no per-credit games, no "you ran out of enrichment credits mid-project" nonsense.</p>

        <p>Larger datasets (100K+ records) may take 3-5 days instead of 24-48 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What data sources do you use?</h3>
          <p>We pull from 50+ sources including LinkedIn, company websites, SEC filings, press releases, job postings, and proprietary databases. We use multiple sources per field to maximize accuracy and coverage.</p>

          <h3>What's your match rate?</h3>
          <p>Match rates vary by field and industry. For US-based companies, we typically see 85-95% match rates on firmographic data (industry, employee count, revenue) and 70-85% on contact data (email, phone). We'll give you specific expectations after reviewing your data.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich specific fields only?</h3>
          <p>Yes. If you only need phone numbers, or only need industry classification, we can focus on exactly what you're missing. Pricing adjusts accordingly.</p>

          <h3>How fresh is the data?</h3>
          <p>We pull fresh data at time of enrichment, not from a static database. For ongoing accounts, we recommend quarterly refreshes to catch job changes and company updates.</p>
        </div>
