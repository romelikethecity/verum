        <h2>Your Database Is Shrinking</h2>

        <p>Every year, 30% of your B2B data becomes obsolete. People change jobs. Companies close or get acquired. Phone numbers disconnect. Email addresses bounce.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, new businesses are opening. New decision-makers are getting promoted. New opportunities are appearing in your market. And they're going to your competitors first.</p>

        <p>The companies that win aren't just maintaining their databases. They're actively discovering new prospects before anyone else reaches them.</p>

        <h2>What We Discover</h2>

        <p>We use multiple data sources and methods to surface prospects you don't have:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>New business detection.</strong> We scan Google Places, business registries, and public records to identify businesses that recently opened in your target market. Get to them before your competitors know they exist.</li>

          <li><strong>Market expansion research.</strong> Entering a new geography or vertical? We map the entire market so you know who's there, not just who you happen to find.</li>

          <li><strong>Net-new contact discovery.</strong> Find key decision-makers at companies you're already targeting. Fill gaps in your account coverage.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitor customer identification.</strong> Understand who your competitors are selling to. Identify opportunities to win business away.</li>

          <li><strong>Event and trigger monitoring.</strong> Track hiring signals, funding announcements, and other events that indicate buying intent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Healthcare Discovery</h2>

        <p>We've built specialized discovery capabilities for healthcare and life sciences companies:</p>

        <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(0, 184, 148, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 184, 148, 0.05) 100%); border: 2px solid var(--color-teal); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: var(--space-xl); margin: var(--space-xl) 0;">
          <h3 style="color: var(--color-teal); margin-top: 0;">New Practice Detection</h3>
          <p>We scan for new healthcare practices across 16+ specialties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weekly scanning of major metropolitan areas</li>
            <li>Monthly scanning of smaller markets</li>
            <li>NPI Registry cross-reference for provider verification</li>
            <li>Practice type classification (private practice, regional health system, academic medical center)</li>
            <li>Key contact identification (practice manager, office manager, billing contact)</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">New practices are often the best prospects. They're making buying decisions, establishing vendor relationships, and haven't been bombarded by every other sales rep yet.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p>Every discovery project delivers a complete prospect list ready for outreach:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Business information.</strong> Company name, address, phone, website, and business category.</li>

          <li><strong>Contact information.</strong> Key decision-maker names with LinkedIn profiles where available.</li>

          <li><strong>Enrichment data.</strong> Firmographic details like employee count, revenue range, and industry classification.</li>

          <li><strong>Newness scoring.</strong> How recently was this business established or this contact identified? Newer often means better opportunity.</li>

          <li><strong>Source attribution.</strong> Where did we find each prospect? Useful for tracking which discovery methods work best for your market.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>One-Time vs. Ongoing Discovery</h2>

        <p>Discovery can be a one-time project or an ongoing service:</p>

        <p><strong>One-time discovery</strong> makes sense when you're entering a new market, building a target account list for a campaign, or doing annual planning. We deliver a complete prospect list for your target criteria.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing discovery</strong> makes sense when you need a constant flow of new prospects. We scan your market weekly or monthly and deliver new finds as they appear. Check out our <a href="/services/data-maintenance.html">Ongoing Maintenance</a> service for details.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Define your target market.</strong> Geography, industry, company size, specialty, whatever criteria matter to your business.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We scan multiple data sources.</strong> Google Places, business registries, public records, industry databases, and our proprietary discovery methods.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We validate and enrich.</strong> Every prospect gets verified before delivery. No point discovering contacts that don't exist.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get a ready-to-use prospect list.</strong> Complete with contact information, enrichment data, and source attribution.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Discovery pricing depends on scope: geography, industry specificity, and whether you need one-time or ongoing delivery.</p>

        <p>One-time discovery projects typically range from $1,500 to $5,000 depending on market size and research depth.</p>

        <p>Ongoing discovery is available as part of our <a href="/services/data-maintenance.html">Ongoing Maintenance</a> packages.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How is this different from buying a list?</h3>
          <p>List vendors sell the same data to everyone. Discovery finds prospects that aren't in those databases yet - new businesses, recent hires, companies that haven't been added to commercial databases. You get a head start.</p>

          <h3>How fresh is the data?</h3>
          <p>For one-time projects, we run discovery at the time of your project. For ongoing discovery, we scan weekly or monthly depending on your package. You're always getting current data, not data that's been sitting in a database for years.</p>

          <h3>Can you discover contacts at specific companies?</h3>
          <p>Yes. If you have a target account list and need to fill gaps in contact coverage, we can discover key decision-makers at those specific companies. This is account-based discovery rather than market-wide discovery.</p>

          <h3>What if you don't find enough prospects?</h3>
          <p>We'll tell you upfront if your target criteria is too narrow to support meaningful discovery. Better to know before you start than to be disappointed with results.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Find Prospects Before Your Competitors</h2>

        <p>Your competitors are working the same lists you are. They're calling the same contacts, emailing the same inboxes, fighting for the same attention.</p>

        <p>Discovery gives you prospects they don't have. New businesses, new contacts, new opportunities that haven't been bombarded by every other vendor yet.</p>
