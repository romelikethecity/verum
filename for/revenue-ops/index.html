        <h2>RevOps Has the Hardest Data Job</h2>

        <p>Sales Ops worries about their data. Marketing Ops worries about theirs. But you? You have to make all of it work together.</p>

        <p>The same customer appears differently in marketing, sales, and customer success systems. Duplicates split the customer journey. Attribution doesn't work because the data doesn't connect. Your single source of truth is actually three conflicting sources of confusion.</p>

        <p>RevOps needs data that works across functions. Not just clean marketing data and clean sales data—but unified data that tells one consistent story from first touch to renewal.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We had three versions of every company—one in Marketo, one in Salesforce, one in Gainsight. None of them matched. After unification, we finally have one customer record that everyone trusts."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— VP Revenue Operations</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>RevOps Data Problems We Solve</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Fragmented customer records.</strong> Same customer exists differently across systems. We unify records into a single source of truth.</li>

          <li><strong>Cross-system duplicates.</strong> Duplicates within systems and across systems. We identify and resolve them with proper merge logic.</li>

          <li><strong>Broken attribution.</strong> Can't attribute revenue to marketing because data doesn't connect from lead to opportunity. We fix the linkages.</li>

          <li><strong>Missing lifecycle data.</strong> Gaps in the customer journey because data fields aren't populated or standardized. We fill and standardize.</li>

          <li><strong>Reporting inconsistency.</strong> Marketing reports one number, sales reports another, finance reports a third. We normalize the data so reports align.</li>

          <li><strong>Data governance gaps.</strong> No consistent rules for how data enters and flows through systems. We help establish and enforce standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Do for RevOps</h2>

        <p><strong>Data unification.</strong> Merge customer records across marketing automation, CRM, and customer success platforms. One customer, one record, one truth.</p>

        <p><strong>Cross-system deduplication.</strong> Find duplicates that exist within and across systems. Proper merge logic that preserves history from all sources.</p>

        <p><strong>Lifecycle data completion.</strong> Fill gaps in the customer journey—missing touchpoints, incomplete records, unstandardized fields. The full picture.</p>

        <p><strong>Attribution data fix.</strong> Ensure marketing touches connect to leads, leads connect to opportunities, opportunities connect to revenue. Attribution that works.</p>

        <p><strong>Master data management.</strong> Establish golden records for accounts and contacts. Consistent data across all systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing data governance.</strong> Help establish rules and processes for maintaining data quality across functions. Prevention, not just cleanup.</p>

        <h2>The RevOps Value</h2>

        <p>Unified data means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>One source of truth.</strong> Marketing, sales, and CS all working from the same customer data. No more "which number is right" debates.</li>
          <li><strong>Working attribution.</strong> Revenue connects to marketing investment because the data actually links together.</li>
          <li><strong>Complete customer view.</strong> See the full journey from first touch through renewal. No gaps, no duplicates, no confusion.</li>
          <li><strong>Aligned teams.</strong> When everyone trusts the data, alignment becomes possible. Shared metrics, shared understanding.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalable operations.</strong> Automation and AI work when data is consistent. Bad data breaks every tool you add.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common RevOps Projects</h2>

        <p><strong>Data unification:</strong> Merge records across 2-4 systems into unified customer records. Usually 4-8 weeks depending on complexity.</p>

        <p><strong>Full-funnel cleanup:</strong> Comprehensive data quality across marketing, sales, and CS systems. Pre-work for new RevOps platforms or major initiatives.</p>

        <p><strong>Attribution data fix:</strong> Specifically focused on connecting marketing touchpoints to pipeline and revenue. Often reveals 20-40% more attributable pipeline.</p>

        <p><strong>Master data implementation:</strong> Establish golden records and ongoing governance. Foundation for long-term data quality.</p>

        <h2>Pricing for RevOps</h2>

        <p>RevOps projects tend to be more comprehensive. Typical ranges:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data unification:</strong> $10,000-30,000 depending on number of systems and complexity</li>
          <li><strong>Full-funnel cleanup:</strong> $15,000-40,000 for comprehensive multi-system work</li>
          <li><strong>Attribution fix:</strong> $5,000-15,000 focused on marketing-to-revenue linkage</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing governance:</strong> $3,000-8,000/month for multi-system maintenance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Build a Real Single Source of Truth</h2>

        <p>RevOps can't function without unified data. We help you build the foundation—clean, connected, consistent data that everyone can trust.</p>
