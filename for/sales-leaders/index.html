        <h2>Bad Data Is Stealing Your Reps' Selling Time</h2>

        <p>You hired salespeople to sell. But they're spending significant time on data tasks: looking up correct phone numbers, figuring out which of three duplicate records is right, researching companies that should already be in the CRM, updating stale contact information.</p>

        <p>Research shows reps spend 20-30% of their time on non-selling activities. A big chunk of that is dealing with data problems. That's time that should be spent with customers.</p>

        <p>When reps don't trust the data, they do their own research. They keep shadow spreadsheets. They avoid the CRM entirely. The tool that's supposed to help them becomes a source of frustration.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"My reps were complaining about CRM data constantly. Duplicates, wrong numbers, missing information. After cleanup, the complaints stopped. They just use the system now because it works."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— VP of Sales</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What Bad Data Costs You</h2>

        <p>Let's do the math:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>10-rep team</strong> at $80K base salary average</li>
          <li><strong>25% of time</strong> on data tasks = 10 hours/week per rep</li>
          <li><strong>100 hours/week</strong> across the team = $40K/month in wasted salary</li>
          <li><strong>Plus lost deals</strong> from wrong contacts, missed follow-ups, poor targeting</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A $10K data cleanup project pays for itself in the first month of recovered selling time.</p>

        <h2>Signs Your Data Needs Attention</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reps complain about bad numbers.</strong> They call, nobody answers or it's the wrong person. Repeatedly.</li>

          <li><strong>Duplicate accounts cause territory disputes.</strong> Same company appears in multiple territories. Reps argue about ownership.</li>

          <li><strong>Email sequences bounce.</strong> SDRs send sequences that bounce 10%+. Deliverability suffers, results decline.</li>

          <li><strong>Reps keep their own spreadsheets.</strong> They don't trust the CRM so they maintain parallel systems. You lose visibility.</li>

          <li><strong>Pipeline reports don't add up.</strong> Same deal appears multiple times, wrong values, missing data. Forecasting is guesswork.</li>

          <li><strong>New reps ramp slowly.</strong> They inherit territories full of garbage data. First month is cleanup, not selling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Clean Data Gets You</h2>

        <p><strong>More selling time.</strong> When data is accurate, reps don't waste time verifying and correcting. They just sell.</p>

        <p><strong>Better connect rates.</strong> Verified phone numbers and emails mean reps reach people on first try, not fifth.</p>

        <p><strong>CRM adoption.</strong> When the CRM has good data, reps actually use it. No more shadow systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Accurate forecasting.</strong> Clean pipeline data means forecasts you can trust. No more explaining why last month's number was wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>Faster new rep ramp.</strong> Hand new reps a clean territory, not a data cleanup project. They start selling immediately.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>

        <p>We handle the data work your team doesn't have time for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Validate contact data.</strong> Verify every phone number and email. Remove bad records, flag outdated ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Eliminate duplicates.</strong> Find and merge duplicate accounts and contacts. Clean up the mess.</li>
          <li><strong>Enrich missing data.</strong> Fill in gaps—direct dials, company info, decision-maker contacts.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep it clean.</strong> Ongoing maintenance so the database stays accurate. No more annual cleanup projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Executive Summary</h2>

        <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(0, 184, 148, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 184, 148, 0.05) 100%); border: 2px solid var(--color-teal); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: var(--space-xl); margin: var(--space-xl) 0;">
          <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>Problem:</strong> Bad data wastes 20-30% of rep time and causes missed opportunities.</p>
          <p style="margin: 1rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>Solution:</strong> We validate, clean, and maintain your sales database.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>Result:</strong> Reps sell more, complain less, and trust the CRM.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Investment</h2>

        <p>Typical sales data projects:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>One-time cleanup:</strong> $5,000-15,000 depending on database size</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing maintenance:</strong> $1,500-4,000/month to keep it clean</li>
          <li><strong>ROI:</strong> Usually pays for itself within 1-2 months in recovered selling time</li>
        </ul>
