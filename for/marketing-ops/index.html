        <h2>Marketing Ops Lives and Dies by Data Quality</h2>

        <p>You build the campaigns. You set up the automations. You segment the audiences. But when the data is bad, none of it works the way it should.</p>

        <p>Emails bounce and your sender reputation tanks. Leads get scored wrong because firmographic data is missing. Campaigns hit the wrong people because job titles aren't standardized. ABM programs fail because account data is incomplete.</p>

        <p>You can't fix this with better campaign strategy. You fix it by fixing the data. That's what we do.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our bounce rate was 6%. Email team was panicking about deliverability. After validation and cleanup, we're consistently under 1.5%. Our campaigns actually reach people now."</blockquote>

        <h2>Marketing Ops Data Problems We Solve</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Email deliverability.</strong> High bounce rates, spam complaints, declining open rates. We validate emails and remove bad addresses before they hurt your sender reputation.</li>

          <li><strong>Missing segmentation data.</strong> Can't segment by industry, company size, or role because the data isn't there. We enrich records with the fields you need.</li>

          <li><strong>Lead scoring inaccuracy.</strong> Scores don't reflect reality because the data feeding the model is incomplete. We fill the gaps so scoring works.</li>

          <li><strong>ABM account gaps.</strong> Running account-based campaigns but missing contact coverage, company data, or account hierarchies. We complete the picture.</li>

          <li><strong>Marketing contact bloat.</strong> Paying for contacts who bounced years ago, never engage, or are completely invalid. We identify who to archive.</li>

          <li><strong>Duplicate contacts.</strong> Same person appears 3 times, splitting engagement history and confusing nurture tracks. We merge and prevent duplicates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Do for Marketing Ops</h2>

        <p><strong>Email list hygiene.</strong> Validate every email address. Remove invalids, catch-alls, and role addresses. Get bounce rates under control before your domain gets blacklisted.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing contact audit.</strong> Identify contacts that shouldn't be marketing contacts—bounces, unengaged, invalid data. Stop paying for worthless records.</p>

        <p><strong>Segmentation data enrichment.</strong> Fill the fields that drive segmentation—industry, company size, job function, seniority. Campaigns hit the right people.</p>

        <p><strong>Lead scoring data fix.</strong> Enrich the firmographic and demographic data that feeds your scoring model. Scores that actually predict conversion.</p>

        <p><strong>ABM data completion.</strong> For target accounts, we ensure you have complete contact coverage, accurate company data, and proper account hierarchies.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing list maintenance.</strong> Weekly email validation, monthly enrichment passes. Your database stays healthy without constant attention.</p>

        <h2>The Marketing Ops Value</h2>

        <p>Clean data means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Better deliverability.</strong> Bounce rates under 2%. Your emails reach inboxes instead of spam folders.</li>
          <li><strong>Accurate segmentation.</strong> Campaigns hit the right audiences because the segmentation data is complete and accurate.</li>
          <li><strong>Working lead scores.</strong> Scores predict actual conversion because the data feeding the model is right.</li>
          <li><strong>Lower costs.</strong> Stop paying for invalid contacts in HubSpot, Marketo, or other platforms with contact-based pricing.</li>
          <li><strong>Reliable attribution.</strong> Attribution models work when there aren't duplicates splitting touchpoint data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Marketing Ops Projects</h2>

        <p><strong>Email list cleanup:</strong> Validate entire email database, remove invalids, segment by risk level. Usually 1-2 weeks.</p>

        <p><strong>HubSpot marketing contact reduction:</strong> Identify contacts that shouldn't be billable. Often saves 20-40% on contact costs.</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-campaign data prep:</strong> Enrich and validate list before a major campaign or ABM launch. Ensure quality before you send.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing hygiene:</strong> Weekly email validation, monthly contact review. Never have a deliverability crisis again.</p>

        <h2>Pricing for Marketing Ops</h2>

        <p>Most Marketing Ops projects fall into a few categories:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email validation:</strong> $0.02-0.05 per email</li>
          <li><strong>Marketing contact audit:</strong> $1,500-5,000 depending on database size</li>
          <li><strong>Segmentation enrichment:</strong> $0.15-0.40 per contact</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing maintenance:</strong> $1,000-3,000/month</li>
        </ul>
