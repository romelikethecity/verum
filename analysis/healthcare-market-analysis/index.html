Your actual market is a fraction of that. Payer dynamics, regulatory requirements, and long sales cycles make healthcare uniquely complex. We size what you can actually capture.</p>

        <h2>Healthcare Market Sizing Requires Specialization</h2>

        <p>Healthcare companies love to cite the total addressable market as some massive slice of $4 trillion in US healthcare spending. Investors are skeptical because they've heard it before. The actual serviceable market for any healthcare technology is orders of magnitude smaller.</p>

        <p><strong>Provider fragmentation creates complexity.</strong> There are over 6,000 hospitals, 200,000 physician practices, and countless other healthcare organizations. But they don't all buy the same things. A rural critical access hospital has completely different needs than an academic medical center. Your ICP is specific. Your TAM should reflect that.</p>

        <p><strong>Payer concentration affects dynamics.</strong> Healthcare payers are highly concentrated. A handful of large nationals plus Blues plans plus regional players. Selling to payers is a different motion than selling to providers, with different decision cycles and procurement processes.</p>

        <p><strong>Regulatory requirements create barriers.</strong> HIPAA compliance, FDA approvals, state licensing variations. Some markets require significant regulatory investment before you can even compete. That affects both market size and time to revenue.</p>

        <p><strong>Sales cycles are long and committee-driven.</strong> Healthcare organizations make technology decisions slowly, with multiple stakeholders. Your market isn't just the organizations that fit your ICP. It's the ones where you can actually get a decision made in a reasonable timeframe.</p>

        <p>Real healthcare market analysis accounts for these factors. Otherwise you're presenting numbers that investors won't believe and that won't help you allocate resources.</p>

        <h2>What Healthcare Market Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We build market sizing from provider and payer data, not industry spending estimates. How many organizations fit your criteria? What's their technology spend? Where is competition weak?</p>

        <p><strong>Provider segmentation.</strong> Hospitals, health systems, physician practices, ambulatory centers. By specialty, size, geography, and ownership type.</p>

        <p><strong>Payer analysis.</strong> Commercial insurers, Medicare contractors, Medicaid managed care. Concentration by market and segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive landscape.</strong> Who serves each segment? Where are incumbents entrenched? Where are there gaps and emerging opportunities?</p>

        <p><strong>Regulatory environment.</strong> Compliance requirements, FDA pathways if relevant, state-by-state variations. How regulation affects market entry and competitive position.</p>

        <p><strong>Growth and consolidation trends.</strong> M&A activity, provider consolidation, technology adoption trends. What's changing in the market?</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Bottom-up TAM.</strong> Market size built from provider/payer counts with realistic spend assumptions. Defensible numbers for investors.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment matrix.</strong> Opportunity by organization type, size, specialty, and geography. Where to focus and why.</li>

          <li><strong>Organization database.</strong> Actual healthcare organizations in your market. TAM becomes prospecting list.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitive intelligence.</strong> Who serves which segments. Market share estimates. Positioning opportunities.</li>

          <li><strong>Regulatory considerations.</strong> Compliance requirements and how they affect market entry and competitive dynamics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Scope definition (1-2 days).</strong> Define your market. Provider or payer focus? What organization types? What use cases?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data collection (3-5 days).</strong> Pull provider data from NPI registry, state licensing, organization databases. Payer data from regulatory filings.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Market sizing (3-4 days).</strong> Count organizations by segment, estimate spend potential, build TAM matrix.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Competitive and regulatory analysis (2-3 days).</strong> Map competitive landscape. Assess regulatory impact by segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Synthesis and delivery.</strong> Combine sizing, competitive, and regulatory analysis into strategic recommendations.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-4 weeks depending on scope and complexity.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you size healthcare markets?</h3>
          <p>Provider databases (NPI registry, state licensing), payer enrollment data, organization databases. Bottom-up counting by specialty, facility type, and geography.</p>

          <h3>Can you segment by provider type?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Hospitals vs practices vs ASCs. Primary care vs specialists. Academic vs community. Each has different buying processes and needs.</p>

          <h3>What about payer markets?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Payer segments by type, size, and geography. Concentrated buyers, regulated pricing, complex contracting. Different dynamics from provider markets.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle regulatory complexity?</h3>
          <p>HIPAA, FDA if relevant, state variations. We include regulatory landscape analysis and how it affects market entry and competition.</p>
