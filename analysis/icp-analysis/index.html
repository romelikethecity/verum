        <h2>The Problem With Most ICP Definitions</h2>

        <p>Ask any B2B company about their ICP and you'll get something like "mid-market SaaS companies with 50-500 employees." Sounds reasonable. It's also useless for actually deciding where to spend your next marketing dollar.</p>

        <p>Generic ICPs create three problems:</p>

        <p><strong>Your SDRs waste time on bad-fit accounts.</strong> "Mid-market SaaS" describes thousands of companies. Your team can't prioritize, so they work the list alphabetically or by whoever responds first. Meanwhile, your actual best customers have specific patterns you're not looking for.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing spreads budget too thin.</strong> When everyone in the ICP looks the same on paper, you can't concentrate spend. The result is mediocre reach across a huge TAM instead of dominant presence in the segments that actually convert.</p>

        <p><strong>Sales cycles drag because you're not speaking their language.</strong> Different segments have different buying triggers, different objections, different timelines. When you treat them all the same, you miss the specific messaging that would accelerate deals.</p>

        <p>The fix isn't a better guess. It's looking at your own data to find which customers actually perform best. Who has the highest LTV? Who churns fastest? Who closes quickest? The answers are already in your CRM. You just haven't pulled them out yet.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Found segments we'd completely ignored. The data showed patterns our sales team had never noticed."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Frédéric, VP Revenue</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What ICP Analysis Actually Involves</h2>

        <p>We start with your CRM data. Every closed deal you have. Won and lost. Then we enrich it with firmographic data you're probably missing: accurate employee counts, revenue ranges, tech stack, funding history.</p>

        <p><strong>Win rate analysis by segment.</strong> Which company types close at 60% and which close at 15%? Most companies have segments with 4-5x win rate differences and don't know it. Finding those patterns changes how you prioritize.</p>

        <p><strong>LTV and churn correlation.</strong> Some segments look great at close but churn in 6 months. Others seem small but expand every year. We calculate actual lifetime value by segment so you know where to invest.</p>

        <p><strong>Deal velocity by segment.</strong> A segment with 30% win rate and 60-day cycles might be better than one with 40% win rate and 180-day cycles. We map the full picture so you can make informed tradeoffs.</p>

        <p><strong>Segment overlap analysis.</strong> Your best customers often share 3-4 characteristics, not just one. RevOps team size plus tech stack plus growth rate. We find the combinations that actually predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Budget allocation recommendations.</strong> Raw analysis isn't enough. We translate patterns into specific guidance: put 40% of budget here, deprioritize this segment, avoid these accounts entirely.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Executive summary.</strong> Key findings, strategic recommendations, and budget allocation guidance. What your board or leadership needs to see.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment profiles.</strong> Detailed breakdown of each customer segment with win rates, average deal size, sales cycle length, churn rates, and LTV.</li>

          <li><strong>Prioritization framework.</strong> Clear guidance on which segments to pursue aggressively, which to serve opportunistically, and which to avoid.</li>

          <li><strong>Messaging recommendations.</strong> What resonates with each segment based on patterns in won vs lost deals.</li>

          <li><strong>Raw data and methodology.</strong> The underlying analysis so your team can build on it as you collect more data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1-2 days).</strong> You export your CRM data. Closed-won, closed-lost, churned accounts. We'll tell you exactly which fields we need.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Cleaning and enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Your CRM data has gaps. We fill them. Missing employee counts, outdated industry classifications, incomplete firmographics.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis (5-7 days).</strong> We run the numbers. Win rates, LTV, churn, velocity. By segment, by combination, by time period.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Synthesis (2-3 days).</strong> Numbers into narrative. We turn findings into recommendations your team can actually act on.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery and walkthrough.</strong> We present findings, answer questions, and help you figure out how to operationalize the insights.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>ICP analysis starts at $2,500 for companies with straightforward data and clear segments. More complex analyses with multiple product lines, international markets, or extensive historical data run $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <p>We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data. No surprises.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How much data do I need?</h3>
          <p>Typically 100+ closed deals. More is better, but we've found actionable patterns with less. The key is having outcome data: revenue, churn, expansion.</p>

          <h3>What if my CRM data is messy?</h3>
          <p>Most is. We clean and enrich before analysis. That's why the process takes 2-3 weeks, not 2-3 days.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from doing it ourselves?</h3>
          <p>You could do it. Most teams don't because it takes 40-60 hours of analyst time and requires knowing what patterns to look for. We've done hundreds of these.</p>

          <h3>What do we actually get?</h3>
          <p>Executive summary, segment profiles, prioritization framework, messaging recommendations, and raw data. Not just insights but specific actions.</p>
