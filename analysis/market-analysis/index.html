        <h2>Your Market Sizing Is Probably Fiction</h2>

        <p>Most companies have a TAM slide somewhere. Probably came from a Gartner or Forrester report. Some massive number that sounds impressive to investors. But does it actually describe your market?</p>

        <p><strong>Industry-wide TAM isn't your TAM.</strong> The CRM market might be $80B. But you're not selling to everyone who buys CRM. You have an ICP. You have geographic constraints. You have price points. Your actual addressable market is a fraction of the headline number.</p>

        <p><strong>Market segments have wildly different sizes.</strong> Healthcare might be 20% of your TAM by revenue potential. Or it might be 5%. Without segment-level analysis, you're allocating resources to segments based on intuition, not opportunity.</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive intensity varies by segment.</strong> A big market full of strong competitors might be worse than a smaller market with weak ones. Market size without competitive mapping is half the picture.</p>

        <p><strong>Growth rates differ dramatically.</strong> Some segments are growing 30% annually. Others are flat. Some are declining. Chasing mature markets with growth expectations will disappoint.</p>

        <p>Real market analysis starts with your definition of the market, builds from actual company data, and gives you segment-level intelligence you can act on.</p>

        <h2>What Market Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We size your market from the bottom up. How many companies actually fit your ICP? What's their potential spend? Where are the opportunities?</p>

        <p><strong>TAM sizing by segment.</strong> Not one number but a matrix. How big is each industry segment? Each company size segment? Each geography? Real numbers built from company data.</p>

        <p><strong>Company identification.</strong> Who are the companies in your market? Names, not just counts. This becomes a prospecting list, not just a slide.</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive mapping.</strong> Who else serves these segments? What's their market share? Where is competition intense vs light? Where do you have positioning leverage?</p>

        <p><strong>Penetration analysis.</strong> What percentage of your TAM have you reached? Which segments have low penetration (room to grow) vs high (need to defend)?</p>

        <p><strong>Whitespace identification.</strong> Where are there underserved segments? What market opportunities aren't being addressed by competition?</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>TAM by segment.</strong> Market size broken down by industry, company size, geography, and use case. Real numbers, not estimates.</li>

          <li><strong>Company lists.</strong> The actual companies in your market. Names, firmographic data, and segment classifications. Turns analysis into prospecting.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitive landscape.</strong> Who serves each segment? Market share estimates. Competitive intensity mapping.</li>

          <li><strong>Opportunity scoring.</strong> Which segments offer the best opportunity: large market, growing, low competitive intensity, high fit?</li>

          <li><strong>Strategic recommendations.</strong> Where to focus, where to expand, where to defend. Market-based strategy guidance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Scope definition (1-2 days).</strong> Define your market. What's your ICP? What segments matter? What geography?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sizing analysis (3-4 days).</strong> Count companies, estimate spend potential, build segment-level TAM.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Competitive mapping (2-3 days).</strong> Identify competitors by segment. Estimate market share. Map intensity.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Synthesis and delivery.</strong> Combine sizing and competitive data. Identify opportunities. Deliver recommendations.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-4 weeks depending on market complexity and scope.</p>
