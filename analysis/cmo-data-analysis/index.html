        <h2>Marketing Has a Credibility Problem</h2>

        <p>You have more data than ever. Dashboards, reports, attribution tools, analytics platforms. Every campaign tracked. Every click measured. And yet when the CEO asks what marketing actually contributed last quarter, the answer takes two weeks and still feels squishy.</p>

        <p><strong>Your metrics don't connect to revenue.</strong> MQLs are up. Pipeline is down. Marketing claims credit for influenced deals. Sales says they would have closed anyway. Without rigorous analysis of what actually drives closed business, marketing operates on belief, not proof.</p>

        <p><strong>Attribution is a mess.</strong> First-touch says paid search drives everything. Last-touch says direct does. Multi-touch spreads credit so thin nothing looks impactful. And nobody trusts any of it because nobody's done the work to validate the models.</p>

        <p><strong>Channel performance is unclear.</strong> Events feel important. Content seems valuable. Paid is expensive but measurable. Which channels actually produce quality pipeline? Which produce volume but not velocity? You have opinions. You need data.</p>

        <p><strong>Campaign ROI is guesswork.</strong> That $200K conference sponsorship felt like a success. The webinar series generated leads. But what actually closed? What actually influenced deals? Without connecting campaign activity to outcomes, you're optimizing for activity, not results.</p>

        <p>CMO analysis answers the question that matters: what is marketing actually worth?</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Found segments we'd completely ignored. The data showed patterns our team had never noticed."</blockquote>

        </div>

        <h2>What CMO Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We connect your marketing data to revenue outcomes. Not activity metrics. Not engagement numbers. Actual pipeline and closed business.</p>

        <p><strong>Pipeline contribution analysis.</strong> What percentage of pipeline originates from marketing? What percentage is influenced? How does this vary by segment, channel, and campaign type?</p>

        <p><strong>Attribution modeling.</strong> Which touchpoints actually matter in buying decisions? We test multiple models against your actual closed-won deals to find what predicts revenue.</p>

        <p><strong>Channel effectiveness.</strong> Which channels produce pipeline that closes? At what velocity? At what cost? Not just lead volume but deal quality and conversion rates downstream.</p>

        <p><strong>Campaign ROI.</strong> Which campaigns actually generated positive return? Which felt successful but didn't convert? Where should budget shift?</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive marketing intelligence.</strong> What can we learn about competitor marketing effectiveness from share of voice, positioning, and market presence data?</p>
