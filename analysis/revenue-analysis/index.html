<h2>Revenue Analysis</h2>
<p>Revenue analysis examines your revenue streams by customer segment, product, geography, and time period to identify patterns, opportunities, and risks. Combined with enriched customer data, it reveals which customer types generate the most revenue and where growth potential exists.</p>

<p>Your top-line revenue is growing 20% year-over-year. But is that growth coming from one large customer or broad-based expansion? Are certain segments growing while others shrink? Is expansion revenue masking new business slowdowns? Without segment-level revenue analysis, you're steering with aggregate numbers.</p>

<h2>How We Analyze Revenue</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Revenue segmentation.</strong> We break down revenue by customer segment, product line, geography, and cohort to show where growth is coming from.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer enrichment.</strong> We append firmographic data to revenue records so you can analyze revenue by industry, company size, and other dimensions you don't currently track.</li>
    <li><strong>Trend analysis.</strong> We identify revenue trends by segment over time: which segments are growing, plateauing, or declining.</li>
    <li><strong>Concentration risk.</strong> We measure revenue concentration to identify dependence on specific customers, segments, or products that represent risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Expansion opportunity.</strong> We identify customer segments with the highest expansion potential based on current penetration versus total available spend.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Revenue Analysis Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Revenue breakdown by customer segment showing where your money actually comes from</li>
    <li>Growth trend analysis by segment revealing which parts of your business are accelerating or decelerating</li>
    <li>Concentration risk assessment highlighting dependence on specific customers or segments</li>
    <li>Expansion opportunity ranking showing which segments have the most room to grow</li>
</ul>
