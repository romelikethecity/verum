        <h2>You Know Your Revenue But Not Your Revenue</h2>

        <p>Every company knows their total revenue. Most know it by month and quarter. Some know it by product line. Very few actually understand the dynamics underneath the numbers.</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue concentration goes unnoticed until it's a crisis.</strong> Your top 10 customers might represent 40% of revenue. You won't know until one leaves and the board asks questions. Concentration risk hides in plain sight.</p>

        <p><strong>Growth and decline blend into one number.</strong> Total revenue grew 15%. Great. But one segment grew 40% while another declined 20%. The growing segment deserves investment. The declining segment needs attention or abandonment. Averages hide both.</p>

        <p><strong>New vs expansion vs recurring blur together.</strong> Is growth coming from new customers or expansion of existing ones? Is recurring revenue stable or slowly eroding? These questions have different answers and different implications.</p>

        <p><strong>Product and customer segment profitability is unknown.</strong> You have gross margin numbers. You don't have them by segment. Some customers cost more to serve. Some products have better margins. But nobody's done the math.</p>

        <p>Revenue analysis answers the questions that should drive strategy: where is money coming from, where is it going, and what should you do about it?</p>

        <h2>What Revenue Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We take your transaction data and slice it every way that matters. The goal is understanding composition, dynamics, and risk.</p>

        <p><strong>Segment composition.</strong> Revenue by customer type, industry, size, geography. Which segments matter most? How is the mix changing?</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue type analysis.</strong> New business vs expansion vs renewal. One-time vs recurring. How healthy is each component? What's growing and declining?</p>

        <p><strong>Concentration analysis.</strong> Customer concentration, segment concentration, product concentration. Where are the risks? What happens if key customers leave?</p>

        <p><strong>Growth dynamics.</strong> Which segments are growing fastest? Which are shrinking? What's driving the change? Is growth sustainable?</p>

        <p><strong>Cohort trends.</strong> How do customer cohorts perform over time? Do newer customers perform better or worse than older ones? Is the business getting healthier?</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See Your Revenue Patterns</a>
        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Revenue composition report.</strong> Detailed breakdown by segment, product, geography, and customer type. Where revenue comes from today.</li>

          <li><strong>Trend analysis.</strong> How composition is changing over time. Which segments are gaining share, which are losing.</li>

          <li><strong>Concentration assessment.</strong> Customer, segment, and product concentration metrics. Risk quantification and diversification opportunities.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth driver analysis.</strong> What's driving growth: new acquisition, expansion, retention improvements? Which lever matters most?</li>

          <li><strong>Strategic recommendations.</strong> Where to invest, where to diversify, where to defend. Revenue-based strategy guidance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1-2 days).</strong> Transaction-level revenue data with customer and product attributes.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Add firmographic data for customer segmentation. Normalize product categories if needed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Composition analysis (3-4 days).</strong> Slice revenue by every relevant dimension. Build segment-level views.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Dynamics analysis (2-3 days).</strong> Analyze trends, cohorts, growth drivers, and risk factors.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Synthesis and delivery.</strong> Turn analysis into strategic recommendations. Present findings with implications.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Revenue analysis starts at $2,500 for companies with clean transaction data and straightforward questions. More complex analyses with multiple product lines, detailed segmentation, or profitability integration run $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote based on data complexity and scope.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What revenue data do you analyze?</h3>
          <p>Transaction-level data: amount, customer, product, date. We slice by segment, product, geography, channel, and time. Where money comes from and where it's going.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from finance reports?</h3>
          <p>Finance shows totals. Analysis explains composition and dynamics. Which segments grow? Where is risk concentrated? Strategic questions finance doesn't address.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify concentration risks?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Customer, segment, product, geographic concentration. If too much depends on too few sources, we quantify the risk and identify diversification opportunities.</p>

          <h3>Do you analyze recurring vs one-time?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Different revenue types have different values. Understanding the mix and how it's changing is critical for planning.</p>
