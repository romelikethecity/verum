        <h2>Your TAM Slide Probably Needs Work</h2>

        <p>Every SaaS pitch deck has a TAM slide. Usually some massive number from Gartner or Forrester that makes the market look exciting. Investors have seen these slides a thousand times. They know the actual addressable market is a fraction of the headline.</p>

        <p><strong>Analyst reports use top-down methodology.</strong> They start with total category spending and apply growth rates. That's fine for understanding overall trends. It's useless for understanding your specific opportunity. Your product doesn't serve all of enterprise software. It serves a segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Your ICP is more specific than you show.</strong> You might sell CRM software. But you sell to mid-market companies. In certain industries. Who use specific technology stacks. Who have sales teams of a certain size. That's not the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-04-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-crm-software-revenue-to-reach-80-billion-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 billion CRM market</a>. That's your market.</p>

        <p><strong>Market segments have wildly different sizes.</strong> The healthcare segment of your market might be 5x larger than financial services. Or the reverse. Without segment-level analysis, you're allocating resources based on intuition.</p>

        <p><strong>Competition varies by segment.</strong> Some segments are dominated by entrenched players. Others are open. A $5B market with 50 competitors might be worse than a $500M market with 3. Market size without competitive mapping is incomplete.</p>

        <p>Serious SaaS market analysis starts with company data and builds toward defensible numbers.</p>

        <h2>What SaaS Market Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We size your market from company databases, not analyst reports. How many companies actually fit your ICP? What do they spend on software like yours? Where are the opportunities?</p>

        <p><strong>Company-level TAM.</strong> Count the companies that fit your criteria. Apply realistic spend assumptions based on company size and category. Build defensible numbers.</p>

        <p><strong>Segment breakdowns.</strong> Market size by industry, company size, geography, technology stack. Not one number but a matrix of opportunities.</p>

        <p><strong>Technology adoption analysis.</strong> Who uses the tech stack you integrate with? Who uses competitors? Where are there technology gaps that create opportunities?</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive intelligence.</strong> Who serves each segment? What's their positioning? Where is market share concentrated? Where is it fragmented?</p>

        <p><strong>Growth and trend analysis.</strong> Which segments are growing? Which are mature? What technology trends affect adoption? Where is momentum?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Market sizing (3-4 days).</strong> Count companies, apply spend assumptions, build segment-level TAM.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Competitive analysis (2-3 days).</strong> Map competitors to segments. Assess market share and positioning.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Synthesis and delivery.</strong> Combine sizing and competitive data into strategic recommendations.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-4 weeks depending on scope and complexity.</p>
