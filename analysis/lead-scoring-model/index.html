        <h2>Your Lead Scoring Is Probably Wrong</h2>

        <p>Marketing set up lead scoring two years ago. Someone decided that downloading an ebook was worth 5 points, visiting the pricing page was worth 10, and being a Director or above added 15. Maybe they read a blog post about best practices. Maybe they made it up.</p>

        <p>That's how most lead scoring works. And it's why most lead scoring doesn't work.</p>

        <p><strong>Engagement signals don't predict fit.</strong> Your hottest lead (most clicks, most downloads) might be a student researching for a thesis. Meanwhile, your best prospects request a demo once and close in two weeks. Activity isn't intent.</p>

        <p><strong>Fit signals are guesses without data.</strong> You think 500+ employees is good. Is it? You think "VP of Marketing" converts well. Does it? Without analyzing actual conversions, you're scoring based on assumptions.</p>

        <p><strong>Thresholds are arbitrary.</strong> MQL at 50 points. SQL at 100. Where did those numbers come from? What percentage of leads at each threshold actually convert? If you don't know, your scoring is just categorization theater.</p>

        <p><strong>Old models degrade.</strong> The market you sold to two years ago isn't today's market. Your ICP evolved. The attributes that predicted conversion in 2023 might not work in 2025. Models need updating.</p>

        <p>Real lead scoring starts with your conversion data. Who actually became a customer? What did they have in common before they converted? Work backward from outcomes, not forward from assumptions.</p>

        <h2>What Data-Driven Scoring Involves</h2>

        <p>We analyze your historical leads with known outcomes. Who converted to customer? Who didn't? Then we find what attributes actually correlate with conversion.</p>

        <p><strong>Firmographic conversion analysis.</strong> Which company sizes convert? Which industries? Which geographies? Not which you think convert. Which actually do, based on your data.</p>

        <p><strong>Role and title analysis.</strong> Which job titles and seniority levels close deals? Do VPs convert better than Directors? Do practitioners convert better than executives in your business?</p>

        <p><strong>Source and channel analysis.</strong> Which lead sources produce customers? Paid search vs organic vs events vs referrals. Attribution to conversion, not just attribution to lead.</p>

        <p><strong>Engagement correlation.</strong> Which engagement behaviors actually predict conversion? Not all activity is equal. Some pages matter. Some downloads matter. Most don't.</p>

        <p><strong>Threshold calibration.</strong> At what score do leads actually become worth sales time? What's the conversion rate at each score band? Set thresholds based on data, not round numbers.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Scoring model.</strong> Specific attributes with point values based on actual conversion correlation. Ready to implement in your CRM.</li>

          <li><strong>Validation analysis.</strong> How well does the model predict? What's the conversion rate at each score band? Confidence metrics for each scoring factor.</li>

          <li><strong>Threshold recommendations.</strong> Where to set MQL and SQL thresholds based on conversion rates. What each threshold actually means in terms of probability.</li>

          <li><strong>Implementation guide.</strong> How to configure scoring in HubSpot, Salesforce, or your CRM. Which fields to use. How to handle missing data.</li>

          <li><strong>Monitoring recommendations.</strong> How to track scoring accuracy over time. When to update. What metrics indicate model degradation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1-2 days).</strong> Historical leads with outcomes. Who became a customer? Who didn't? When? How much?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Fill firmographic gaps. Your lead data has holes. We add missing company sizes, industries, and other attributes.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Correlation analysis (4-5 days).</strong> Which attributes correlate with conversion? Statistical analysis across dimensions. Find what actually predicts outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Model development (2-3 days).</strong> Build scoring weights from correlation data. Validate against holdout set. Calibrate thresholds.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Documentation and delivery.</strong> Scoring model, implementation guide, validation metrics, monitoring recommendations.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Lead scoring model development starts at $2,500 for companies with clean lead data and straightforward conversion paths. More complex models with multiple products, long sales cycles, or integration support run $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote after understanding your situation.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How is this different from HubSpot's scoring?</h3>
          <p>HubSpot's default uses engagement (opens, clicks). We add fit signals based on actual conversions. What company characteristics predict closes? Ideally you use both.</p>

          <h3>How much historical data do I need?</h3>
          <p>At least 6 months of leads with known outcomes. Ideally 12+ months. More data means more confident scoring.</p>

          <h3>Can I implement this in my CRM?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We deliver criteria that work in HubSpot, Salesforce, or any CRM with scoring. Attributes and point values you can configure.</p>

          <h3>How often should scoring be updated?</h3>
          <p>Annually at minimum. Markets change, products evolve. We can do initial development plus annual refreshes.</p>
