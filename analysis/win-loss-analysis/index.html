<h2>Win Loss Analysis</h2>
<p>Win/loss analysis examines your closed opportunities — both won and lost — to identify the firmographic, behavioral, and process patterns that predict outcomes. It reveals which deals you should be pursuing, which you should be avoiding, and what your team can do differently to improve win rates.</p>

<p>Your win rate is 25%. That means 75% of the effort your sales team puts into pipeline results in nothing. Are you losing because of price, product, process, or fit? Without systematic analysis of lost deals, every loss is a one-off story rather than a pattern you can fix.</p>

<h2>How We Analyze Win/Loss</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Opportunity enrichment.</strong> We append firmographic data to both won and lost opportunities so we can compare them across 20+ attributes.</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern comparison.</strong> We identify which attributes appear significantly more often in won deals versus lost deals: industry, company size, buying committee size, deal stage velocity, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Competitive loss analysis.</strong> For deals lost to competitors, we identify patterns in which competitor wins against you in which segments.</li>
    <li><strong>Process analysis.</strong> We examine the sales activities and process steps on won vs lost deals to identify behavioral differences that predict outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Segment win rate calculation.</strong> We calculate win rates by market segment so your team can focus effort where close rates are highest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Win/Loss Analysis Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A win profile and loss profile showing the firmographic attributes that predict each outcome</li>
    <li>Segment-level win rates so your team knows where they win most often and can prioritize accordingly</li>
    <li>Competitive loss patterns identifying which competitors beat you in which segments</li>
    <li>Process recommendations based on behavioral differences between won and lost deals</li>
    <li>An updated ICP that incorporates win/loss patterns, not just customer-only analysis</li>
</ul>
