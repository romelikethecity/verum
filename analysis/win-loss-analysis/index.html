        <h2>You're Pursuing Deals You Can't Win</h2>

        <p>Every quarter, your sales team spends cycles on deals that were never going to close. The prospect seemed like a fit. They took meetings. They asked for a proposal. Then they went dark, chose a competitor, or decided to do nothing. Your reps are back to square one.</p>

        <p>The pattern repeats because nobody's looking at the data systematically.</p>

        <p><strong>Lost deal reasons are guesses, not facts.</strong> "Went with competitor." "Budget constraints." "Timing wasn't right." Reps log what the prospect said, which is rarely the real reason. And nobody aggregates these to find patterns.</p>

        <p><strong>Win rate varies wildly by segment, but you don't know which.</strong> Some company types close at 60%. Others close at 7%. Without analysis, you treat them the same. Your SDRs fill the pipeline with low-probability deals that clog the forecast.</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive dynamics are black boxes.</strong> Which competitors do you beat? Which beat you? Under what conditions? Your reps have opinions. Data has answers.</p>

        <p><strong>Deal velocity patterns go unnoticed.</strong> Some deals close in 30 days. Others drag for 6 months and still lose. Fast-moving deals have characteristics. Knowing what predicts velocity would change qualification.</p>

        <p>A 20% win rate isn't a ceiling. It's an average that masks huge variation. Some segments might be 50%. Others might be 5%. Finding the difference changes everything.</p>

        <h2>What Win-Loss Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your closed deals (won and lost) to find what actually drives outcomes. Not opinions. Patterns in the data.</p>

        <p><strong>Win rate by segment.</strong> Which company sizes, industries, and use cases do you close at high rates? Which have dismal conversion? This becomes your prioritization framework.</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive win rates.</strong> When you face Competitor A, what happens? What about Competitor B? Under what conditions do you win competitive deals? When should you walk away?</p>

        <p><strong>Deal velocity patterns.</strong> What predicts fast closes? Slow closes? Deals that stall? Velocity correlates with certain prospect characteristics and deal structures.</p>

        <p><strong>Deal size correlation.</strong> Do larger deals take longer? Have lower win rates? Require different sales motion? Understanding the tradeoffs helps you decide which deals to pursue.</p>

        <p><strong>Stage conversion analysis.</strong> Where do deals die in your pipeline? Are there stages where certain segments get stuck? Knowing this helps both forecasting and qualification.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Segment win rates.</strong> Detailed breakdown of win rates by company size, industry, use case, source, and other relevant dimensions.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitive analysis.</strong> Win rates against specific competitors. Conditions that favor you vs them. Positioning recommendations.</li>

          <li><strong>Qualification framework.</strong> Clear criteria for which deals to pursue aggressively, which to pursue cautiously, and which to deprioritize.</li>

          <li><strong>Velocity analysis.</strong> What predicts deal speed? How to identify deals that will drag and decide whether they're worth it.</li>

          <li><strong>Pipeline health assessment.</strong> Current pipeline analyzed against historical patterns. Which deals are likely to close? Which are forecast risk?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1-2 days).</strong> CRM export of closed deals. Won and lost. As much history as you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Fill firmographic gaps. Your CRM probably has incomplete data on lost deals. We fix that.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Pattern analysis (5-7 days).</strong> Statistical analysis of win rates across dimensions. Segment the data multiple ways to find meaningful patterns.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Synthesis (2-3 days).</strong> Turn patterns into actionable guidance. Qualification criteria. Competitive positioning. Forecasting adjustments.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery and review.</strong> Present findings. Answer questions. Help you figure out how to operationalize insights.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Win-loss analysis starts at $2,500 for straightforward analysis with clean CRM data. More complex projects with competitive deep-dives, multiple product lines, or extensive historical data run $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How many deals do I need?</h3>
          <p>At least 50 closed deals combined. Ideally 100+. More deals mean more confident conclusions. We can work with less but findings will be more directional.</p>

          <h3>Do you interview lost prospects?</h3>
          <p>That's a separate service. Our core analysis uses CRM data and enrichment. Interview-based research adds depth but takes longer and costs more.</p>

          <h3>What if our lost deal data is incomplete?</h3>
          <p>Most is. Reps log won deals carefully, lost deals loosely. We supplement with enrichment. Even imperfect data reveals valuable patterns.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from pipeline reports?</h3>
          <p>Reports show conversion rates. Analysis explains why. Which prospects convert? What predicts outcomes? Analysis goes deeper than metrics.</p>
