        <h2>You Have Reports But Not Answers</h2>

        <p>Your Salesforce instance has been collecting data for years. You have dashboards. Pipeline reports. Activity metrics. But when it comes to actually understanding what drives sales performance, you're still guessing.</p>

        <p><strong>Rep performance varies wildly but you don't know why.</strong> Top reps close 3x more than bottom reps. Is it territory? Lead quality? Activity levels? Something they do differently in discovery? You see the results but not the causes.</p>

        <p><strong>Pipeline looks healthy until it isn't.</strong> Deals get stuck. Forecast commits slip. Opportunities that seemed real disappear. The warning signs were probably there. You just didn't know to look for them.</p>

        <p><strong>Activities don't correlate to outcomes the way you'd expect.</strong> More calls should mean more closed deals. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't. Which activities actually matter? You have activity data but no activity intelligence.</p>

        <p><strong>Forecasts are consistently wrong in predictable ways.</strong> Some reps are always optimistic. Some deal types always slip. Some stages mean less than others. You know forecasts are off. You don't know why or how to fix them.</p>

        <p>The data to answer these questions is in your CRM. It's just buried under years of accumulation, inconsistent logging, and reports that show numbers without context.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Found segments we'd completely ignored. The data showed patterns our sales team had never noticed."</blockquote>

        <h2>What Sales Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We pull your CRM data and look for patterns that explain performance. Not just what happened, but why it happened and what to do about it.</p>

        <p><strong>Rep performance drivers.</strong> What do top performers do differently? Territory quality? Activity patterns? Deal selection? Close technique? We find the differences that can be replicated.</p>

        <p><strong>Pipeline velocity analysis.</strong> How fast do deals move through stages? Where do they get stuck? What predicts a deal that will drag forever vs one that will close quickly?</p>

        <p><strong>Conversion rate analysis.</strong> Stage-to-stage conversion by rep, territory, deal type, source. Where does pipeline leak? Which stages are filter stages vs rubber stamps?</p>

        <p><strong>Activity correlation.</strong> Which activities actually correlate with closed deals? Calls? Emails? Meetings? The relationship isn't always what you'd assume.</p>

        <p><strong>Forecast accuracy analysis.</strong> Where do forecasts go wrong? Which stages are optimistic? Which reps over-commit? What deal characteristics predict slippage?</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Performance analysis.</strong> What distinguishes top performers from average? Which factors are controllable and which are luck?</li>

          <li><strong>Pipeline health assessment.</strong> Current pipeline analyzed against historical patterns. What's likely to close? What's at risk? What's probably dead already?</li>

          <li><strong>Conversion benchmarks.</strong> Stage-by-stage conversion rates with segment breakdowns. Where you're strong and where you're leaking.</li>

          <li><strong>Forecast model.</strong> What predicts actual close rates? How to weight pipeline for more accurate forecasts.</li>

          <li><strong>Operational recommendations.</strong> Specific changes to improve performance. Activity focus areas. Pipeline management improvements. Rep coaching priorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data export (1-2 days).</strong> Pull opportunity, activity, account, and contact data from your CRM. We'll specify exactly what we need.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data cleaning (2-3 days).</strong> Normalize inconsistent data. Handle missing fields. Prepare for analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis (5-7 days).</strong> Statistical analysis across multiple dimensions. Find patterns, correlations, and anomalies.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Synthesis (2-3 days).</strong> Turn findings into actionable recommendations. Prioritize by impact and feasibility.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery and review.</strong> Present findings, answer questions, help with implementation planning.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Sales data analysis starts at $2,500 for focused analyses with clean CRM data. Comprehensive reviews covering multiple dimensions run $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote based on scope and complexity.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What sales data do you analyze?</h3>
          <p>CRM data: opportunities, activities, contacts, accounts. Pipeline, conversion, velocity, activity, territory, and forecast data.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from our dashboards?</h3>
          <p>Dashboards show metrics. Analysis explains them. Why do some reps outperform? Which activities correlate with wins? Analysis investigates.</p>

          <h3>Can you help with forecasts?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We analyze historical forecasts vs actuals to find where predictions go wrong. Better inputs lead to better forecasts.</p>

          <h3>What if our CRM data is messy?</h3>
          <p>Most is. We work with what you have and flag quality issues. Sometimes analysis reveals where your data discipline needs work.</p>
