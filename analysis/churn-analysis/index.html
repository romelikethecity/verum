        <h2>You're Losing Customers You Could Save</h2>

        <p>Every churned customer sent signals before they left. Login frequency dropped. Support tickets changed tone. They stopped opening emails. Meetings got rescheduled, then cancelled. By the time they sent the cancellation notice, the decision was made weeks ago.</p>

        <p>The problem isn't that warning signs don't exist. They do. The problem is nobody's looking for them systematically.</p>

        <p><strong>Customer success works reactively.</strong> They respond when customers complain, not when usage patterns shift. By the time a customer raises issues, they've often already started evaluating alternatives.</p>

        <p><strong>Usage data sits in product analytics, disconnected from CRM.</strong> Your CS team doesn't see the dashboards. Your BI team doesn't know which accounts matter. The data exists in silos that nobody's connecting.</p>

        <p><strong>Churn reasons are recorded but never analyzed.</strong> "Budget cuts." "Went with a competitor." "Not a good fit." These get logged and forgotten. Nobody's looking for patterns across churned accounts.</p>

        <p><strong>High-value accounts get the same attention as small ones.</strong> Without risk scoring, your team can't prioritize. They spread effort evenly when they should be concentrating on accounts that matter.</p>

        <p>Acquiring a customer costs 5x more than keeping one. Every preventable churn hit your revenue twice: the lost contract and the acquisition cost to replace it.</p>

        <h2>What Churn Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your churned accounts alongside your retained ones. The goal is finding what makes the difference. Not general best practices from blog posts. Specific patterns in your data.</p>

        <p><strong>Churn by customer segment.</strong> Some segments churn at 5% annually. Others at 40%. Knowing which is which changes your acquisition strategy, not just your retention efforts.</p>

        <p><strong>Early warning indicators.</strong> What behaviors predict churn? For some companies, it's login frequency. For others, it's support ticket sentiment. For others, it's the presence (or absence) of a champion. We find what matters for you.</p>

        <p><strong>Time-to-churn patterns.</strong> How long do at-risk accounts take to cancel? Is there a window for intervention? When is it too late? Understanding the timeline changes how your team responds.</p>

        <p><strong>Churn reason analysis.</strong> What do churned customers have in common beyond what they told you? Same industry? Same company size? Same acquisition channel? The real reason is often different from the stated reason.</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue impact quantification.</strong> Not all churn is equal. We calculate the actual dollar impact by segment so you can prioritize where to focus prevention efforts.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Churn segment analysis.</strong> Which customer segments have the highest churn rates, and why? What characteristics predict retention vs departure?</li>

          <li><strong>Early warning model.</strong> The specific indicators that predict churn for your business. Which metrics to track, what thresholds matter, how early you can detect risk.</li>

          <li><strong>At-risk account list.</strong> Current customers showing warning signs, ranked by risk level and revenue impact.</li>

          <li><strong>Prevention playbooks.</strong> Intervention strategies matched to churn reasons. What to do when you spot specific warning signs.</li>

          <li><strong>Acquisition implications.</strong> Which segments to avoid acquiring in the first place because they churn too fast to be profitable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1-2 days).</strong> Customer records, churn history, usage data if available. We'll specify exactly what we need.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Fill gaps in firmographic data. Add missing company sizes, industries, and other attributes that might correlate with churn.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Pattern analysis (5-7 days).</strong> Statistical analysis of churned vs retained customers. Segment-level breakdown. Behavioral correlation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Model building (3-4 days).</strong> Create predictive indicators based on patterns found. Test against historical data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery and recommendations.</strong> Present findings, walk through at-risk accounts, provide prevention strategies.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Churn analysis starts at $2,500 for companies with clean data and clear churn events. More complex analyses with multiple product lines, usage data integration, or extensive historical analysis run $4,000-$7,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote after reviewing your data situation.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How early can you predict churn?</h3>
          <p>Typically 60-90 days. Warning signs appear months before cancellation. We find which signals matter for your business specifically.</p>

          <h3>What data do you need?</h3>
          <p>Customer records with churn dates, usage data if available, support history, engagement metrics. More behavioral data means better predictions.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze churn that already happened?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Retrospective analysis is actually the best starting point. Understanding past churn informs both prevention and acquisition targeting.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from a churn dashboard?</h3>
          <p>Dashboards show churn is happening. Analysis tells you why and what to do. We find patterns and give you prevention strategies.</p>
