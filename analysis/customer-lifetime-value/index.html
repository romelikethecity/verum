        <h2>You Don't Actually Know What Your Customers Are Worth</h2>

        <p>Most companies know their average contract value. Some know average revenue per customer. Very few know actual customer lifetime value. And almost nobody knows it by segment.</p>

        <p>Without CLV, you're making expensive decisions blind.</p>

        <p><strong>Acquisition budgets are guesses.</strong> How much should you pay to acquire a customer? Without CLV, you don't know. You set CAC targets based on what feels reasonable or what competitors seem to be doing. That's not strategy. That's hope.</p>

        <p><strong>All customers get equal treatment.</strong> Some customers will generate 5x more value than others over their lifetime. But you treat them the same during onboarding, give them the same support tier, and invest the same in retention. That's inefficient in both directions.</p>

        <p><strong>Retention investments are arbitrary.</strong> Should you hire another CSM? Build a customer marketing program? Offer discounts to prevent churn? These questions are impossible to answer without knowing what a retained customer is actually worth.</p>

        <p><strong>Segment prioritization is gut-feel.</strong> You think enterprise customers are more valuable. Are they? After you factor in longer sales cycles, higher support costs, and lower expansion rates, maybe mid-market is actually more profitable. You won't know until you measure.</p>

        <p>CLV answers the question that drives every other decision: which customers are worth the most, and what should you do about it?</p>

        <h2>What CLV Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We calculate customer lifetime value using your actual data. Not industry benchmarks. Not formulas from a textbook. Your customers, your retention rates, your expansion patterns.</p>

        <p><strong>Retention curves by segment.</strong> How long do different customer types stay? Year 1 retention? Year 2? Year 3? Retention patterns vary dramatically by segment and understanding the curves changes valuation.</p>

        <p><strong>Expansion and contraction.</strong> Which customers grow over time? Which shrink? Net revenue retention by segment. Expansion more than offsets churn for some segments. Others decline steadily.</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue composition.</strong> Initial contract vs expansion vs upsell. Where does the money actually come from over a customer's lifetime? Different revenue sources have different margins.</p>

        <p><strong>Cost allocation.</strong> Support burden, implementation costs, success team time. Some segments are more expensive to serve. CLV without cost consideration overstates actual value.</p>

        <p><strong>Segment breakdowns.</strong> CLV by company size, industry, use case, acquisition channel. Not one number but a matrix of values that shows where the profitable customers are.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>CLV by segment.</strong> Lifetime value calculations for each customer segment. Which are worth the most? Which cost more than they're worth?</li>

          <li><strong>Component breakdown.</strong> Where value comes from: initial sale, expansion, retention. Which components drive value for which segments?</li>

          <li><strong>Retention analysis.</strong> Cohort-based retention curves by segment. How long do customers stay? When do they leave?</li>

          <li><strong>Acquisition guidance.</strong> What CAC should you target for each segment based on CLV? Where should you spend more vs less?</li>

          <li><strong>Investment recommendations.</strong> Which customers deserve more service investment? Which segments should you actively grow? Which should you deprioritize?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1-2 days).</strong> Customer records, revenue history, churn dates. The more history, the better the model.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Add firmographic data for segmentation. Fill gaps in customer attributes.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Cohort analysis (4-5 days).</strong> Build retention curves, measure expansion, calculate revenue over time by segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Value modeling (2-3 days).</strong> Calculate lifetime value by segment. Sensitivity analysis for key assumptions.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery and strategy.</strong> Present findings with investment recommendations. Help you operationalize CLV in decisions.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>CLV analysis starts at $2,500 for companies with clean subscription data and straightforward segments. More complex analyses with multiple products, usage-based pricing, or detailed cost allocation run $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote after understanding your data and goals.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What's included in CLV calculation?</h3>
          <p>Initial contract, expansion revenue, retention probability, support costs if available, and acquisition cost. The full economics of the relationship.</p>

          <h3>How much historical data do I need?</h3>
          <p>At least 12 months to see retention patterns. Ideally 24-36 months. More history means more confident predictions.</p>

          <h3>Can you calculate CLV by segment?</h3>
          <p>That's the point. Average CLV isn't actionable. Segment-level CLV tells you where to invest. Different segments often have 3-5x value differences.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from average revenue?</h3>
          <p>ARPC is a snapshot. CLV predicts total value over the relationship. Accounts for retention, expansion, and time.</p>
