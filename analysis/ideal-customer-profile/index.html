        <h2>Your ICP Probably Isn't Working</h2>

        <p>Every B2B company has an ideal customer profile somewhere. A document that describes who you're targeting. Company size, industry, maybe some technology requirements. The problem is that most ICPs are vague enough to be useless and outdated enough to be wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>Too broad to be actionable.</strong> "Mid-market B2B companies in North America" isn't an ICP. It's a category that includes hundreds of thousands of companies. An ICP should be specific enough that when a sales rep sees a prospect, they know immediately whether it's a good fit.</p>

        <p><strong>Based on assumptions, not data.</strong> Most ICPs were created in a conference room based on what founders or executives believed about their ideal customer. Those beliefs might have been right then. They might be wrong now. Without data validation, you don't know.</p>

        <p><strong>Focused on firmographics only.</strong> Company size and industry matter. But so does technology stack, growth rate, team composition, and buying process. The best ICPs include both demographic and behavioral characteristics.</p>

        <p><strong>Never updated as you learn.</strong> Your first ICP was a hypothesis. Your current customers are data. Every closed deal, every expansion, every churn is evidence about who actually succeeds with your product. That evidence should update your ICP. Usually it doesn't.</p>

        <p>A data-driven ICP changes how you allocate resources across the entire go-to-market motion.</p>

        <h2>What ICP Development Involves</h2>

        <p>We analyze your actual customers to find what distinguishes the great ones from the rest. Then we turn those patterns into actionable targeting criteria.</p>

        <p><strong>Customer outcome analysis.</strong> Define what success means for your business. Retention? Expansion? NPS? Low support burden? We measure customers against outcomes that matter.</p>

        <p><strong>Firmographic pattern identification.</strong> Company size, industry, geography, growth rate. Which combinations predict customer success?</p>

        <p><strong>Technographic analysis.</strong> What technology stacks do successful customers use? What tools indicate fit? We look at both required integrations and general technology sophistication.</p>

        <p><strong>Behavioral indicators.</strong> Buying process, decision speed, champion characteristics. The situational factors that affect how well a customer does with your product.</p>

        <p><strong>Market sizing.</strong> How many companies fit your ICP? Is the market big enough? Which sub-segments are largest?</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Complete ICP document.</strong> Specific, actionable customer criteria across firmographic, technographic, and behavioral dimensions.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment profiles.</strong> Not one ICP but a prioritized set of segments. Tier 1 (primary), Tier 2 (secondary), Tier 3 (opportunistic).</li>

          <li><strong>Scoring framework.</strong> Weighted criteria your team can use to evaluate any prospect against ICP fit. Removes subjectivity.</li>

          <li><strong>Market sizing by segment.</strong> How many companies fit each tier? Is your TAM sufficient for growth targets?</li>

          <li><strong>Implementation guide.</strong> How to operationalize ICP in sales, marketing, and customer success. What changes based on the findings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1-2 days).</strong> Export customer records with outcome data: retention, expansion, engagement metrics.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Add firmographic, technographic, and behavioral data from external sources.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Pattern analysis (3-4 days).</strong> Identify characteristics that predict success. Find the combinations that matter.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: ICP synthesis (2-3 days).</strong> Build the ICP framework, scoring model, and segment prioritization.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Strategy delivery.</strong> Present findings with implementation recommendations for sales, marketing, and product.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>ICP development starts at $2,500 for companies with clean customer data and straightforward segments. More complex analyses run $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote after understanding your data and goals.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What's included in ICP development?</h3>
          <p>Customer analysis, pattern identification, success metrics, segment profiling, market sizing, and targeting recommendations. A complete, usable ICP.</p>

          <h3>How is ICP different from buyer personas?</h3>
          <p>ICP defines company characteristics. Personas define the people within those companies. ICP tells you which companies to target. Personas tell you who to reach and how to message.</p>

          <h3>Can you update an existing ICP?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We analyze current data to validate or refine existing ICP. Sometimes updates are minor. Sometimes we find the original was significantly off.</p>

          <h3>How do I use ICP once developed?</h3>
          <p>ICP informs everything in GTM: which accounts sales pursues, how marketing allocates budget, what content you create. We include implementation guidance.</p>
