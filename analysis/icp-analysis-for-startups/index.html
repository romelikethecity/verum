<h2>Icp Analysis For Startups</h2>
<p>Startups need an ICP even more than established companies, but they have less data to build one from. With fewer customers and shorter history, pattern recognition is harder. We help startups build useful ICPs from small datasets by combining customer data with market analysis.</p>

<p>You have 20 customers and a hunch about who your ideal buyer is. Your Series A investors want a data-backed TAM and ICP. Your sales team is targeting everyone because nobody's defined who they should focus on. You need an ICP but don't have enough customers for traditional analysis.</p>

<h2>ICP Analysis for Small Datasets</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer enrichment.</strong> Even with 20 customers, we can append firmographic data that reveals patterns invisible in your CRM's sparse records.</li>
    <li><strong>Win/loss analysis.</strong> We analyze not just who you've won, but who you've lost and who never responded. The contrast often reveals ICP signals that customer-only analysis misses.</li>
    <li><strong>Market mapping.</strong> We identify how many companies match your emerging ICP criteria to validate the addressable market size before you commit resources to targeting them.</li>
    <li><strong>Hypothesis testing.</strong> We test your team's assumptions about your ICP against the enriched data. Which assumptions hold up? Which are wrong?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Startup ICP Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A directional ICP with specific criteria, clearly labeled with confidence levels for each attribute</li>
    <li>Market size estimate for the ICP segment so you can assess whether the opportunity is large enough</li>
    <li>A prospect list matching the ICP criteria to accelerate your next round of outreach</li>
    <li>A framework for updating the ICP as you close more deals and the dataset grows</li>
</ul>
