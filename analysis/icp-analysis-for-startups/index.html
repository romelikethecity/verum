        <h2>You Have Customers But Not Clarity</h2>

        <p>Early-stage startups have a paradox. You need to focus to succeed, but you don't have enough data to know where to focus. You've sold to whoever would buy. Some customers love you. Others struggle. You have a sense of who your ideal customer is, but it's based on intuition, not evidence.</p>

        <p><strong>Your ICP hypothesis is probably too broad.</strong> "Mid-market B2B SaaS companies" isn't a target. It's a category. Which mid-market companies? What characteristics differentiate the ones who succeed from the ones who churn? Without specificity, your sales and marketing efforts are diluted.</p>

        <p><strong>Early success is often misleading.</strong> Your first customers came through warm intros, founder networks, and luck. They're not necessarily representative of your actual market. The patterns that got you to $100K ARR won't get you to $1M.</p>

        <p><strong>You're probably serving too many segments.</strong> Seed-stage companies often have customers scattered across industries, company sizes, and use cases. That's fine for learning. It's terrible for focus. You need to identify which segment deserves 80% of your attention.</p>

        <p><strong>Resource allocation is guesswork.</strong> Should you build features for enterprise or SMB? Should marketing target healthcare or fintech? Without ICP clarity, you're making expensive decisions based on opinions.</p>

        <p>Startup ICP analysis extracts signal from limited data to help you focus before you scale.</p>

        <h2>What Startup ICP Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We work with whatever customer data you have and enrich it to find patterns that aren't visible in small sample sizes.</p>

        <p><strong>Data enrichment.</strong> Your customer list might be 15 rows in a spreadsheet. We add firmographic data, technographic data, and behavioral indicators to enable pattern analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Success definition.</strong> What does success look like for your customers? Usage frequency? Expansion? NPS? We define success metrics appropriate for your stage.</p>

        <p><strong>Pattern identification.</strong> Which characteristics do successful customers share? We look for combinations of firmographics, technographics, and situational factors that predict outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>Market validation.</strong> Is your ICP large enough to support your goals? We size the market segment that matches your ideal customer characteristics.</p>

        <p><strong>Negative persona identification.</strong> Which customer types don't work? Knowing who not to pursue is as valuable as knowing who to target.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">Define Your Startup ICP</a>
        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>ICP definition.</strong> Specific customer criteria based on your actual data. Not assumptions, not hopes. What the data says about who succeeds.</li>

          <li><strong>Success patterns.</strong> What characteristics predict customer success? How confident can you be given sample size?</li>

          <li><strong>Market sizing.</strong> How many companies fit your ICP? Is the segment large enough for your growth targets?</li>

          <li><strong>Focus recommendations.</strong> Which segment deserves most of your attention. Where to double down and where to pull back.</li>

          <li><strong>Negative personas.</strong> Who to avoid. Customer types that don't work with your product or business model.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1 day).</strong> Export your customer list with whatever attributes you have. Usage data if available.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Add firmographic, technographic, and behavioral data to enable analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Success analysis (2-3 days).</strong> Define success metrics. Identify which customer characteristics predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Market validation (1-2 days).</strong> Size the market segment matching your ICP. Assess viability.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Strategy delivery.</strong> Present findings with focus recommendations and implementation guidance.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 1-2 weeks from data handoff.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Startup ICP analysis starts at $1,500 for companies with 10-30 customers. More complex analyses with multiple product lines or very limited data run $2,000-$3,000.</p>

        <p>Designed to be accessible for early-stage companies while providing real analytical rigor.</p>
