        <h2>E-commerce Market Data Is Everywhere. Insight Is Rare.</h2>

        <p>You can Google e-commerce market size and get a number within seconds. That number is useless. It doesn't tell you how many merchants are in your addressable segment, what they spend on solutions like yours, or where competition is thin versus overwhelming.</p>

        <p><strong>Top-down TAM is fiction.</strong> "The e-commerce market is $5 trillion" tells investors something. It tells you nothing. Your product doesn't serve all of e-commerce. It serves specific merchant types, specific price points, specific use cases. That's your real market.</p>

        <p><strong>Platform dynamics matter.</strong> Selling to Shopify merchants is different from selling to Amazon sellers is different from selling to enterprise retailers. Platform concentration, seller sophistication, and competitive landscapes vary dramatically.</p>

        <p><strong>Category competition is uneven.</strong> Some e-commerce categories are saturated with vendors fighting for scraps. Others are underserved. Some categories are growing 30% annually. Others are flat. Chasing the biggest market isn't always the smartest move.</p>

        <p><strong>The long tail is massive.</strong> There are millions of small e-commerce merchants. Most make little. Some will grow huge. Identifying which small merchants are worth pursuing requires data, not hope.</p>

        <p>Real e-commerce market analysis starts with your definition of the opportunity and builds from merchant data, not headline numbers.</p>

        <h2>What E-commerce Market Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We size your actual market from the bottom up. How many merchants fit your ICP? What do they spend? Where are the gaps in current solutions?</p>

        <p><strong>Market sizing by segment.</strong> Not one number but a matrix. Market size by platform, category, merchant size, and geography. Real numbers from merchant data.</p>

        <p><strong>Merchant identification.</strong> Who are the companies in your market? Names, not just counts. Merchant databases that can become prospecting lists.</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive landscape.</strong> Who serves each segment? What's their positioning? Where is competition intense? Where are there gaps?</p>

        <p><strong>Platform analysis.</strong> Shopify vs Amazon vs BigCommerce vs enterprise. Merchant concentration, growth trends, and opportunity by platform.</p>

        <p><strong>Category opportunity.</strong> Which e-commerce categories are growing? Which are mature? Where do your solutions fit best?</p>
