        <h2>Your Win Rate Is Lying to You</h2>

        <p>SaaS companies optimize for closes. That's natural. You need new business to grow. But optimizing for closes without considering what happens after the signature is how you end up with high churn, low expansion, and a leaky bucket that never fills.</p>

        <p><strong>Not all customers are created equal.</strong> Some segments sign quickly and churn faster. Others take longer to close but stay for years and expand every renewal. If you're measuring ICP fit by win rate alone, you might be optimizing for the wrong customers.</p>

        <p><strong>Expansion is where SaaS economics work.</strong> Your best customers don't just renew. They buy more seats, add modules, upgrade tiers. Net revenue retention above 100% is the holy grail. But which customer characteristics predict expansion? Most companies don't actually know.</p>

        <p><strong>Churn kills the business model.</strong> Every churned customer represents acquisition cost you'll never recover. But churn isn't random. Certain customer types, company sizes, use cases, and buying patterns predict it. You can see it coming if you look.</p>

        <p><strong>Product-market fit varies by segment.</strong> Your product might be perfect for mid-market companies but a bad fit for enterprise. Great for marketing teams but frustrating for sales. These differences show up in retention, not in initial sales velocity.</p>

        <p>SaaS ICP analysis looks at the full customer lifecycle to find who's actually worth acquiring.</p>

        <h2>What SaaS ICP Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We analyze customers across the entire lifecycle: acquisition, onboarding, adoption, expansion, and retention. The goal is finding which customer characteristics predict long-term value.</p>

        <p><strong>Cohort-based retention analysis.</strong> How do different customer segments retain over time? Which show early warning signs? Which stay predictably?</p>

        <p><strong>Expansion pattern recognition.</strong> Which customer types expand? When do they expand? What triggers expansion? We find the predictors of growth.</p>

        <p><strong>Churn risk factors.</strong> What characteristics predict churn? Company size? Industry? Use case? Buying process? We identify the red flags before they become cancellations.</p>

        <p><strong>Time to value analysis.</strong> Which customers reach value quickly? Which struggle? Fast time to value predicts retention. We find what drives it.</p>

        <p><strong>LTV calculation by segment.</strong> Not one number but a matrix. What's the lifetime value of each customer type? Some segments might be 5x more valuable than others.</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data integration (1-2 days).</strong> Connect customer data, revenue history, product usage if available. Build the analysis foundation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Cohort building (2-3 days).</strong> Segment customers by characteristics. Build cohorts for comparison.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Lifecycle analysis (4-5 days).</strong> Analyze retention, expansion, and churn patterns across cohorts.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Value modeling (2-3 days).</strong> Calculate lifetime value by segment. Identify optimal ICP characteristics.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Strategy delivery.</strong> Present findings with specific recommendations for targeting, pricing, and customer success.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks depending on data complexity.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>SaaS ICP analysis starts at $2,500 for companies with clean subscription data. More complex analyses with multiple products, usage-based pricing, or limited history run $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote based on data availability and analytical complexity.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How is SaaS ICP different from general ICP?</h3>
          <p>SaaS ICP accounts for the subscription model: LTV matters more than initial contract, expansion often exceeds first sale, and churn destroys economics. We weight these factors into the analysis.</p>

          <h3>What metrics do you include?</h3>
          <p>Net revenue retention, expansion rate, gross churn, time to value, support volume, feature adoption. The full customer lifecycle, not just acquisition.</p>

          <h3>How much data do I need?</h3>
          <p>At least 12 months for retention patterns. Ideally 18-24 months. Newer companies can still get useful analysis with confidence caveats.</p>

          <h3>Can you segment by pricing tier?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Different tiers often have fundamentally different ICPs. We analyze each separately and compare.</p>
