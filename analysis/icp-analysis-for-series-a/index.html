        <h2>Series A Is When ICP Mistakes Get Expensive</h2>

        <p>At seed stage, you sold to whoever would buy. That was right. You needed customers, revenue, and learning. Now you're Series A. You're about to 3x your sales team. Build out marketing. Target specific segments. If you target wrong, that capital disappears fast.</p>

        <p><strong>Your current ICP is probably a guess.</strong> Most Series A companies have an ICP document somewhere. It says things like "mid-market SaaS companies" or "B2B marketing teams." That's not specific enough to build a sales motion around. It's not precise enough to tell SDRs who to call.</p>

        <p><strong>Early customers aren't random.</strong> You have 30, 50, maybe 100 customers. They feel all over the place. But they're not. There are patterns in who bought, who renewed, who expanded, who churned. Those patterns tell you something. You just haven't extracted the signal yet.</p>

        <p><strong>Some customers are 5x better than others.</strong> Not all revenue is equal. Some customers close fast, expand, renew, and refer. Others grind through a long sales cycle, fight on price, never expand, and churn. Before you scale, you need to know the difference.</p>

        <p><strong>The sales motion you build now will persist.</strong> Changing ICP after you've hired a team, built playbooks, and trained reps is expensive and slow. Getting it right now is leverage that compounds for years.</p>

        <p>Series A ICP analysis takes what you've learned from early customers and turns it into a precise target for scaling.</p>

        <h2>What Series A ICP Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We analyze your existing customers to find patterns that predict success. Then we build a precise ICP you can actually execute against.</p>

        <p><strong>Customer outcome analysis.</strong> Which customers succeeded? How do you define success? Retention, expansion, NPS, support burden. We measure what matters to your business model.</p>

        <p><strong>Pattern identification.</strong> What characteristics do successful customers share? Company size, industry, tech stack, buying process, use case. We find the combinations that predict outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>Win/loss patterns.</strong> Who do you win? Who do you lose? Under what conditions? Win rate isn't one number. It's a matrix by segment and situation.</p>

        <p><strong>Churn risk factors.</strong> Which customer types churn? When? Why? Understanding churn patterns is as important as understanding wins.</p>

        <p><strong>Expansion potential.</strong> Which customers grow with you? What triggers expansion? These customers are worth more and should be weighted in ICP.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Precise ICP definition.</strong> Specific, actionable customer criteria. Not "mid-market companies" but exact firmographics, technographics, and situational factors.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment prioritization.</strong> Which segments to target first, second, and never. Based on data, not intuition.</li>

          <li><strong>Scoring framework.</strong> How to evaluate prospects against ICP. Weighted criteria your team can apply consistently.</li>

          <li><strong>Market sizing.</strong> How many companies fit your precise ICP? Is the market big enough for your growth targets?</li>

          <li><strong>Board-ready materials.</strong> ICP analysis presented in formats suitable for investor discussions and board presentations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Customer data collection (1-2 days).</strong> Export customer records with outcome data: retention, expansion, engagement, support metrics.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Add firmographic and technographic data to enable pattern analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Outcome analysis (3-4 days).</strong> Define success metrics and analyze which customer characteristics predict them.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: ICP synthesis (2-3 days).</strong> Build the ICP profile, scoring framework, and prioritization matrix.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Strategy delivery.</strong> Present findings with recommendations for go-to-market execution.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Series A ICP analysis starts at $2,500. More complex analyses with multiple product lines or limited historical data run $4,000-$5,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote based on your data availability and specific needs.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why do Series A companies need ICP analysis?</h3>
          <p>Series A is when you scale sales. If ICP is wrong, you're scaling inefficiency. Getting it right before scaling is the highest-leverage investment.</p>

          <h3>Do I have enough data?</h3>
          <p>Most Series A companies have 20-100 customers. That's usually enough with proper enrichment. We can identify patterns even with limited sample sizes.</p>

          <h3>What if our customers are all over the place?</h3>
          <p>That's common and exactly why you need analysis. Diversity doesn't mean no pattern. It means the pattern is hidden.</p>

          <h3>How does this help with board presentations?</h3>
          <p>Shows you're ready to scale efficiently. Answers questions about CAC, segments, and GTM with data instead of intuition.</p>
