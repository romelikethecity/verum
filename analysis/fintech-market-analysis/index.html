        <h2>Fintech Market Sizing Is Uniquely Hard</h2>

        <p>Every fintech pitch deck claims a massive addressable market. The numbers come from analyst reports that aggregate the entire financial services industry. But fintech doesn't work that way. Regulations, switching costs, and risk aversion make the actual addressable market a fraction of the headline.</p>

        <p><strong>Regulatory moats matter.</strong> You can't sell to banks in certain jurisdictions without specific licenses. Some customer segments are practically closed without partnerships. The market size that matters is the one you can actually enter, not the theoretical total.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial institutions don't switch easily.</strong> Banks, credit unions, insurance companies have multi-year vendor relationships with enormous switching costs. Your serviceable market isn't every FI that could use your product. It's the ones whose contracts expire, who are dissatisfied, or who have use cases their current vendors don't serve.</p>

        <p><strong>Vertical dynamics differ dramatically.</strong> The payments market is huge but crowded. Banking infrastructure is smaller but underserved. Compliance tech is growing but commoditizing. Each vertical has its own competitive dynamics, entry barriers, and growth profiles.</p>

        <p><strong>The enterprise-SMB split is critical.</strong> Large FIs move slowly, have complex requirements, and negotiate hard. SMB FIs move faster but have smaller budgets. Where you play determines your market and your GTM motion.</p>

        <p>Real fintech market analysis accounts for these constraints. Otherwise you're presenting fiction to your board and investors.</p>

        <h2>What Fintech Market Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We build market sizing from financial institution data, not analyst projections. How many FIs fit your ICP? What do they spend? Where is competition light?</p>

        <p><strong>Institution-level analysis.</strong> Banks, credit unions, insurance companies, asset managers counted by type and size. Real numbers, not estimates.</p>

        <p><strong>Vertical segmentation.</strong> Market size by fintech category: payments, lending, banking, wealth, insurance, compliance. Where are you competing?</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive landscape mapping.</strong> Who serves each segment? Where is market share concentrated? Where are there gaps and emerging opportunities?</p>

        <p><strong>Regulatory environment.</strong> Licensing requirements, compliance burden, regulatory trends by geography and segment. What affects market entry and competitive dynamics?</p>

        <p><strong>Funding and M&A analysis.</strong> Where is venture capital flowing? What acquisitions signal market consolidation? What trends affect competitive positioning?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Synthesis and delivery.</strong> Combine sizing, competitive, and regulatory analysis into strategic recommendations.</p>
