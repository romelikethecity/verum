<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
<p>Competitor analysis examines your competitors' customer base, market positioning, and coverage to identify where you have advantages and where you're vulnerable. We use firmographic data, technographic signals, and market analysis to provide concrete competitive intelligence.</p>

<p>You know your top 3 competitors by name. But you don't know which industries they're strongest in, what company size they dominate, or where they have gaps in coverage. Without data, your competitive strategy is based on what your sales team hears anecdotally in deal cycles.</p>

<h2>How We Analyze Competitors</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Competitor customer identification.</strong> We identify companies that use your competitors' products through technographic detection, job posting analysis, and other signals.</li>
    <li><strong>Segment comparison.</strong> We compare your customer base against competitors' customer bases by industry, company size, geography, and tech stack to see where each player is strongest.</li>
    <li><strong>Gap analysis.</strong> We identify market segments where competitors are weak or absent — whitespace opportunities for your go-to-market strategy.</li>
    <li><strong>Win/loss enrichment.</strong> If you share win/loss data, we enrich lost deals to identify whether you're losing to specific competitors in specific segments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Intelligence Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Competitor customer profiles showing which industries and company sizes each competitor serves best</li>
    <li>Market coverage maps showing where competitors are concentrated and where gaps exist</li>
    <li>Whitespace opportunities in segments where no competitor has strong coverage</li>
    <li>Competitive positioning recommendations based on where your ICP overlaps with competitors and where it doesn't</li>
</ul>
