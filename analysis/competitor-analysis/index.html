        <h2>You're Fighting the Wrong Battles</h2>

        <p>Your sales team thinks they know the competition. They've seen the comparison charts. They've memorized the objection handlers. But are they winning the deals that matter?</p>

        <p><strong>You don't know your actual win rates against specific competitors.</strong> "We beat Competitor X all the time" might mean 55% vs 45%. Or your team only remembers the wins. CRM competitive data is incomplete. Nobody's doing the real math.</p>

        <p><strong>Differentiation claims don't match reality.</strong> Your battle cards say you're better on X, Y, Z. But what do customers actually choose you for? What do they choose competitors for? Marketing says one thing. Customer behavior says another.</p>

        <p><strong>You're competing where you're weak instead of strong.</strong> Some deals you shouldn't pursue because a competitor is unbeatable in that context. You don't know which ones because nobody's analyzed the patterns.</p>

        <p><strong>Competitor moves catch you by surprise.</strong> Pricing changes, feature launches, market pivots. You find out when you start losing deals, not when you could have prepared.</p>

        <p>Real competitive intelligence isn't about collecting battle cards. It's about understanding where you actually win and building a strategy around that reality.</p>

        <h2>What Competitor Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We combine your internal competitive data with external intelligence to build a complete picture of the competitive landscape.</p>

        <p><strong>Win/loss rates by competitor.</strong> When you face Competitor A, what happens? Competitor B? Under what conditions? Your CRM has this data but nobody's connected it.</p>

        <p><strong>Differentiation validation.</strong> What do you actually win on? Where do customers choose you vs competitors? Does this match what you think your differentiation is?</p>

        <p><strong>Competitor positioning analysis.</strong> How do competitors position themselves? What claims do they make? Where is there messaging overlap vs differentiation?</p>

        <p><strong>Market segment mapping.</strong> Which segments does each competitor focus on? Where is competition intense? Where are there gaps?</p>

        <p><strong>Pricing and packaging intelligence.</strong> How do competitors price? What packaging do they use? Where is there pricing leverage?</p>
