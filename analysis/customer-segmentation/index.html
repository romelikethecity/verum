<h2>Customer Segmentation</h2>
<p>Customer segmentation analysis identifies natural groupings in your customer base based on shared characteristics. Unlike marketing segmentation (which groups prospects), customer segmentation groups existing customers to optimize retention, expansion, and product strategy.</p>

<p>You treat all customers the same because you can't see the differences. But your database has customers ranging from 10-person startups to 5,000-person enterprises, across 8 industries, with wildly different usage patterns. One-size-fits-all onboarding, support, and renewal processes can't serve all of them well.</p>

<h2>Our Segmentation Process</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data enrichment.</strong> We append firmographic and technographic data to every customer record to ensure there's enough depth for meaningful clustering.</li>
    <li><strong>Cluster analysis.</strong> We apply statistical clustering methods to your enriched data to identify natural groupings that represent distinct customer types.</li>
    <li><strong>Segment profiling.</strong> Each segment gets a profile describing its shared characteristics, typical deal size, retention rate, and expansion potential.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic mapping.</strong> We map segments to business implications: which segments deserve premium support, which need different onboarding, and which represent the best expansion opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Segmentation Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Clearly defined customer segments with firmographic profiles for each group</li>
    <li>Performance metrics by segment: average deal size, retention rate, time to close, expansion revenue</li>
    <li>Strategic recommendations for how to serve each segment differently for better outcomes</li>
    <li>Segment assignment for every current customer so your team can start acting on the analysis immediately</li>
</ul>
