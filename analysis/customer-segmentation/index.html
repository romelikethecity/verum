        <h2>The Problem With One-Size-Fits-All</h2>

        <p>Most companies have informal segments. Enterprise vs mid-market vs SMB. Or industry verticals. Or something based on product usage. These categories exist in people's heads but not in systems. They're too broad to drive action.</p>

        <p>When you treat all customers the same, several things break:</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing messages fall flat.</strong> Generic campaigns speak to no one specifically. Your "enterprise" messaging sounds wrong to some enterprise accounts because enterprise isn't a single thing. There are different types of enterprise buyers with different needs.</p>

        <p><strong>Customer success spreads too thin.</strong> Same playbook for everyone. High-touch customers get under-served. Self-serve customers get over-contacted. Nobody gets what they actually need.</p>

        <p><strong>Pricing leaves money on the table.</strong> One pricing model for customers with vastly different value perception. Some segments would pay more. Some need different packaging entirely.</p>

        <p><strong>Product roadmap chases the loudest voice.</strong> Without clear segments, feature requests get equal weight. You build for whoever shouts loudest instead of who matters most.</p>

        <p>The fix isn't more personas from marketing brainstorms. It's looking at your actual customer data to find how they naturally cluster based on what they do and what they're worth.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Found segments we'd completely ignored. The data showed patterns our team had never noticed."</blockquote>

        </div>

        <h2>What Segmentation Analysis Involves</h2>

        <p>We combine multiple data dimensions: firmographic attributes, behavioral patterns, value metrics, and engagement data. The goal is segments that reflect reality, not internal assumptions.</p>

        <p><strong>Value-based clustering.</strong> Which customers generate the most revenue? Which have highest margins? Which expand over time? Value isn't just contract size. It includes retention, expansion, support costs, and referral potential.</p>

        <p><strong>Behavioral patterns.</strong> How do customers actually use your product? Which features matter? How often do they engage? Behavior predicts future value better than demographics.</p>

        <p><strong>Firmographic groupings.</strong> Company size, industry, geography, tech stack. These matter because they correlate with needs, buying processes, and success patterns.</p>

        <p><strong>Needs-based segments.</strong> What are customers trying to accomplish? Why did they buy? Different use cases create different expectations and different definitions of success.</p>

        <p><strong>Lifecycle stages.</strong> New customers vs mature customers vs at-risk vs expanding. Same company can be in different segments at different times.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See Your Segments</a>
        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Segment definitions.</strong> Clear criteria for each segment. Which attributes define membership. How to identify new customers into segments.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment profiles.</strong> Detailed description of each segment: typical company, typical buyer, typical needs, typical value, typical risk factors.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment metrics.</strong> Size of each segment, average revenue, churn rate, expansion rate, support burden. How segments compare on the metrics that matter.</li>

          <li><strong>Treatment recommendations.</strong> How to serve each segment differently. Marketing message adjustments. Service level differentiation. Pricing considerations.</li>

          <li><strong>Implementation guidance.</strong> How to tag customers in your CRM. How to route new customers to segments. How to track segment performance over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data collection (1-2 days).</strong> Customer records, transaction history, usage data if available. We'll specify what we need.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data enrichment (2-3 days).</strong> Fill firmographic gaps. Add missing attributes that might drive segmentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Exploratory analysis (4-5 days).</strong> Look for natural clusters. Test different segmentation approaches. Find what creates meaningful distinction.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Validation (2-3 days).</strong> Test segments against outcomes. Do they predict behavior? Can your team recognize them? Are they actionable?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Documentation and delivery.</strong> Segment definitions, profiles, metrics, and implementation guidance.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 2-3 weeks from data handoff to final delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Customer segmentation analysis starts at $2,500 for companies with clean data and straightforward needs. More complex segmentation with multiple product lines, behavioral data integration, or ongoing refinement runs $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote after understanding your situation.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How many segments should we have?</h3>
          <p>Typically 4-7 for B2B companies. Fewer misses important distinctions. More becomes hard to operationalize. The goal is segments your team can remember and act on.</p>

          <h3>What's the difference from ICP analysis?</h3>
          <p>ICP identifies ideal customers for acquisition. Segmentation groups existing customers for differentiated treatment. ICP is who to pursue. Segmentation is how to serve.</p>

          <h3>Can you combine behavior and firmographics?</h3>
          <p>Yes, and that's usually most valuable. Firmographics alone miss engagement patterns. Behavior alone misses business context. Combining both creates actionable segments.</p>

          <h3>How do we operationalize segments?</h3>
          <p>We deliver clear definitions so you can tag customers in your CRM. Output includes criteria, profiles, and treatment recommendations by segment.</p>
