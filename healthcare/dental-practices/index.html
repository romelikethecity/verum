        <h2>The Dental Market Is Fragmenting and Consolidating Simultaneously</h2>

        <p>Dental is weird. It's the most fragmented healthcare market—over 200,000 practices, most with just one or two dentists. But it's also rapidly consolidating as DSOs (dental service organizations) acquire independent practices.</p>

        <p>This creates data chaos. That independent practice you targeted last month? Now it's a DSO location with centralized purchasing. That general dentist on your list? Retired and sold to a young associate you don't have in your database.</p>

        <p>Dental data changes fast. If you're not validating and updating regularly, you're working a list that's increasingly disconnected from reality.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We discovered 18% of our 'independent practices' had been acquired by DSOs. Our reps were pitching direct purchase to locations that buy through corporate. That's a lot of wasted effort."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— VP Sales, Dental Equipment Company</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Validate and Enrich</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>NPI verification.</strong> Every dentist verified against the NPPES registry. License status confirmed.</li>

          <li><strong>Specialty classification.</strong> General dentistry, orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics. Accurate specialty assignment.</li>

          <li><strong>DSO affiliation.</strong> Identify practices affiliated with dental service organizations. Know which locations buy through corporate vs. independently.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice type.</strong> Solo practice, group practice, DSO-owned, academic, community health center.</li>

          <li><strong>Decision-maker identification.</strong> Dentist-owner, practice manager, office manager, corporate contact for DSO locations.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice location.</strong> Current address verified. Multiple location practices identified.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>DSO Intelligence</h2>

        <p>DSOs have transformed dental purchasing. When a practice joins a DSO, purchasing often shifts to corporate. Your sales motion changes completely.</p>

        <p>We track DSO affiliations for major groups including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Heartland Dental</li>
          <li>Aspen Dental</li>
          <li>Pacific Dental Services</li>
          <li>Dental Care Alliance</li>
          <li>Affordable Care</li>
          <li>And 100+ regional and emerging DSOs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For each DSO-affiliated practice, we identify whether purchasing is centralized, partially centralized, or still practice-controlled.</p>

        <h2>Specialty Matters in Dental</h2>

        <p>Different dental specialties have different needs:</p>

        <p><strong>General dentistry:</strong> Broadest market, most fragmented, mix of independent and DSO.</p>

        <p><strong>Orthodontics:</strong> Specialty practices and general dentists offering ortho. Invisalign vs. traditional brackets.</p>

        <p><strong>Oral surgery:</strong> Often hospital-affiliated. Implants, extractions, complex procedures.</p>

        <p><strong>Periodontics:</strong> Gum disease specialists. Implant placement, surgical procedures.</p>

        <p><strong>Endodontics:</strong> Root canal specialists. High-volume, specialized equipment.</p>

        <p><strong>Pediatric dentistry:</strong> Different patient mix, different equipment needs, often DSO-affiliated.</p>

        <h2>New Practice Detection</h2>

        <p>New dental practices are excellent prospects. They're setting up operatories, choosing suppliers, establishing vendor relationships.</p>

        <p>We monitor for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>New dental practice openings</li>
          <li>Dentists acquiring existing practices</li>
          <li>New graduates entering practice</li>
          <li>Practice expansions (new locations)</li>
          <li>DSO acquisitions (know when an independent goes corporate)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you track DSO affiliations?</h3>
          <p>Multiple sources: DSO corporate websites, state licensing records, practice name patterns, and our proprietary monitoring. DSO landscape changes fast; we update continuously.</p>

          <h3>Can you tell me how many operatories a practice has?</h3>
          <p>Sometimes. This data isn't universally available, but we can estimate based on dentist count and practice type, or find it directly for practices that publish it.</p>

          <h3>Do you cover dental hygienists?</h3>
          <p>We focus on dentists and practices. Hygienists typically don't have purchasing authority, so they're not usually useful for sales targeting.</p>

          <h3>What about dental labs?</h3>
          <p>Dental labs are a different market. We can help if you need lab data, but it requires different data sources than practice data.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Target the Right Dental Practices</h2>

        <p>The dental market is too fragmented for bad data. We validate and enrich your lists so you know who's independent, who's DSO, and who actually makes purchasing decisions.</p>
