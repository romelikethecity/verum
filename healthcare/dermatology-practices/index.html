        <h2>Dermatology Has Multiple Markets Within One Specialty</h2>

        <p>Dermatology is unique. The same specialty code covers practices that are essentially different businesses: medical dermatology treating skin conditions, cosmetic practices doing Botox and fillers, Mohs surgeons focused on skin cancer, and hybrid practices doing everything.</p>

        <p>If you're selling laser equipment, you don't want medical-only practices. If you're selling biologics for psoriasis, you don't want cosmetic-only medspas. The specialty code tells you nothing useful.</p>

        <p>We classify dermatology practices by what they actually do, not just their board certification.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our derm list was 8,000 names. Turned out only 2,500 did significant aesthetics volume. We were wasting two-thirds of our outreach on practices that would never buy our devices."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— VP Sales, Aesthetics Device Company</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>Practice Focus Classification</h2>

        <p>We classify dermatology practices by their primary focus:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Medical dermatology.</strong> Primary focus on treating skin conditions—eczema, psoriasis, acne, skin infections. Insurance-based practice.</li>

          <li><strong>Cosmetic/Aesthetics.</strong> Primary focus on cosmetic procedures—Botox, fillers, lasers, body contouring. Cash-pay or minimal insurance.</li>

          <li><strong>Mohs surgery.</strong> Specialized in skin cancer treatment using Mohs micrographic surgery. Often hospital-affiliated or in surgical centers.</li>

          <li><strong>Hybrid practice.</strong> Significant volume in both medical and cosmetic dermatology. Different decision criteria than pure-play practices.</li>

          <li><strong>Dermatopathology.</strong> Lab-focused practices that read skin biopsies. Not patient-facing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Validate and Enrich</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>NPI verification.</strong> Every dermatologist verified against the NPPES registry. License status confirmed.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice focus.</strong> Medical, cosmetic, Mohs, hybrid—based on procedure analysis and practice positioning.</li>

          <li><strong>Equipment signals.</strong> Where available, what laser/device brands they currently use.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice type.</strong> Solo practice, group practice, PE-backed, hospital-employed, academic.</li>

          <li><strong>Decision-maker identification.</strong> Dermatologist-owner, practice administrator, aesthetic director.</li>

          <li><strong>Location verification.</strong> Current address verified. Medical offices vs. medspa locations distinguished.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Aesthetics Market Intelligence</h2>

        <p>The aesthetics market crosses specialty lines. Many non-dermatologists perform cosmetic procedures. If you're selling to the aesthetics market, you need more than just dermatologists.</p>

        <p>We can identify aesthetics practices across:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Dermatologists (cosmetic-focused)</li>
          <li>Plastic surgeons</li>
          <li>Facial plastic surgeons (ENT)</li>
          <li>Oculoplastic surgeons</li>
          <li>Medspas (non-physician owned, often NP/PA supervised)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Private Equity in Dermatology</h2>

        <p>PE has transformed dermatology. Large groups have acquired hundreds of practices, changing purchasing dynamics.</p>

        <p>We track PE-backed dermatology groups including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>U.S. Dermatology Partners</li>
          <li>Forefront Dermatology</li>
          <li>Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery</li>
          <li>Schweiger Dermatology</li>
          <li>And many regional groups</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For PE-backed practices, purchasing often consolidates at the group level. We identify which practices are PE-affiliated so you know who actually makes decisions.</p>

        <h2>New Practice Detection</h2>

        <p>New dermatology practices—especially aesthetics-focused ones—are prime targets. They're buying equipment, choosing product lines, and establishing vendor relationships.</p>

        <p>We monitor for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>New dermatology practice openings</li>
          <li>New medspa locations</li>
          <li>Dermatologists adding aesthetics services</li>
          <li>Practice expansions and new locations</li>
          <li>PE acquisitions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you determine practice focus?</h3>
          <p>Multiple signals: practice website analysis, procedure volume data where available, equipment listings, practice positioning, and professional association memberships.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify which devices a practice already has?</h3>
          <p>Sometimes. Practices often list their technology on websites. We capture this where available, but coverage is not complete.</p>

          <h3>Do you include medspas that aren't dermatologist-owned?</h3>
          <p>We can. Many medspas are owned by non-dermatologists (nurses, businesspeople) with medical directors. Let us know if you want these included.</p>

          <h3>What about dermatology PAs and NPs?</h3>
          <p>We can include them. In aesthetics especially, mid-levels often perform significant procedure volume and influence purchasing.</p>

        <h2>Target the Right Dermatology Practices</h2>

        <p>Not all dermatologists are your customers. We classify practices by what they actually do so you can focus your sales effort where it matters.</p>
