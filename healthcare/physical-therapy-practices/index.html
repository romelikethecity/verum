        <h2>PT Ownership Is All Over the Map</h2>

        <p>Physical therapy is one of the most ownership-diverse healthcare segments. A solo PT running a cash-pay sports clinic operates completely differently from a 500-location PE-backed chain. Hospital outpatient PT departments have different purchasing than independent practices.</p>

        <p>If you're selling equipment, software, or services to PT clinics, you need to know who actually makes purchasing decisions. A clinic manager at an ATI or US Physical Therapy location doesn't have the same authority as an owner-operator of an independent practice.</p>

        <p>We classify PT practices by ownership structure, specialty focus, and decision-maker authority so your targeting actually works.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Half our PT list was corporate-owned locations with no local purchasing authority. We were pitching clinic managers who literally couldn't say yes. After segmenting by ownership, we focused on independents and our close rate tripled."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Sales Director, PT Equipment Company</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>Ownership Structure Classification</h2>

        <p>We classify PT practices by ownership:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Independent/Owner-operated.</strong> Single-location or small multi-location practices owned by practicing PTs. Full purchasing authority.</li>

          <li><strong>PE-backed chains.</strong> ATI, US Physical Therapy, Athletico, Select Medical, etc. Centralized purchasing, standardized operations.</li>

          <li><strong>Hospital outpatient.</strong> Hospital-owned PT departments. Hospital supply chain purchasing.</li>

          <li><strong>Physician-owned (POPTS).</strong> PT clinics owned by referring physicians. Unique dynamics around referral relationships.</li>

          <li><strong>Regional groups.</strong> Multi-location practices that aren't national chains. May have centralized or distributed purchasing.</li>

          <li><strong>Contract/SNF.</strong> PT services in skilled nursing facilities, often through contract companies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Specialty Focus Classification</h2>

        <p>PT clinics specialize in different populations and conditions:</p>

        <p><strong>Orthopedic/General:</strong> Post-surgical rehab, musculoskeletal conditions. Largest segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Sports medicine:</strong> Athletic injuries, performance training. Often younger patient population.</p>

        <p><strong>Neurological:</strong> Stroke rehab, Parkinson's, MS, brain injury. Specialized equipment needs.</p>

        <p><strong>Pediatric:</strong> Developmental delays, congenital conditions. Different equipment and approach.</p>

        <p><strong>Women's health:</strong> Pelvic floor, pre/postnatal. Growing specialty segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Vestibular:</strong> Balance disorders, vertigo. Specialized assessment equipment.</p>

        <p><strong>Aquatic:</strong> Pool-based therapy. Significant facility requirements.</p>

        <h2>PE Consolidation in PT</h2>

        <p>Private equity has aggressively consolidated PT. Major players include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>ATI Physical Therapy (1,000+ locations)</li>
          <li>US Physical Therapy (600+ locations)</li>
          <li>Athletico (500+ locations)</li>
          <li>Select Medical (outpatient division)</li>
          <li>Upstream Rehabilitation</li>
          <li>And dozens of regional PE-backed groups</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We track PE affiliations because they fundamentally change purchasing dynamics. Corporate-owned locations typically can't make local purchasing decisions on anything significant.</p>

        <h2>What We Validate and Enrich</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>NPI verification.</strong> Practice and individual PT NPIs validated.</li>

          <li><strong>Corporate affiliation.</strong> Parent company for chain-owned locations.</li>

          <li><strong>Specialty focus.</strong> Orthopedic, sports, neuro, peds, etc.</li>

          <li><strong>Decision-maker identification.</strong> Owner, clinic director, regional manager—whoever has purchasing authority.</li>

          <li><strong>Location verification.</strong> Current address, multi-location practice flagging.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you track ownership changes?</h3>
          <p>PT ownership changes constantly as PE rolls up practices. We monitor acquisition announcements, state licensing changes, and practice name/branding changes to stay current.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify which EMR a practice uses?</h3>
          <p>Often yes, especially for larger practices. PT-specific EMRs (WebPT, Prompt, Clinicient) are common and often identifiable.</p>

          <h3>Do you include occupational therapy?</h3>
          <p>Many PT practices also offer OT. We can flag combined PT/OT practices or provide OT-specific lists if that's your target market.</p>

          <h3>What about home health PT?</h3>
          <p>Home health is a different market with different data sources. We can include it but it requires separate targeting criteria.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Target the Right PT Practices</h2>

        <p>PT's ownership fragmentation makes targeting difficult. We classify practices by ownership and specialty so you focus on locations where your sales approach actually works.</p>
