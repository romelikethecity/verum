        <h2>Primary Care Is Huge and Highly Varied</h2>

        <p>There are over 200,000 primary care physicians in the US. It's the largest single market in healthcare. But "primary care" covers enormous variation: solo family docs in rural areas, hospital-employed internal medicine physicians in urban systems, concierge practices, FQHCs, urgent care, retail clinics.</p>

        <p>Each practice type has different purchasing authority, different decision-makers, and different needs. A one-size-fits-all approach to primary care doesn't work.</p>

        <p>We classify primary care practices by type and structure so you can target appropriately.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our primary care list had 50,000 physicians. But when we segmented by practice type, we found that only 15,000 were in settings where they could actually buy our product. The rest were hospital-employed with no purchasing authority. That changed everything about our territory coverage."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Director of Sales, Point-of-Care Diagnostics</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>Specialty Classification</h2>

        <p>We classify primary care physicians by specialty:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Family medicine.</strong> All ages, broadest scope. Largest segment of primary care.</li>

          <li><strong>Internal medicine.</strong> Adult focus. Higher proportion hospital-employed than family medicine.</li>

          <li><strong>Pediatrics.</strong> Children only. Different patient mix, different product needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Geriatrics.</strong> Elderly focus. Growing segment with specific needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Med-Peds.</strong> Combined internal medicine/pediatrics training. Treats all ages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practice Type Classification</h2>

        <p>Practice type determines who makes purchasing decisions:</p>

        <p><strong>Independent/Private practice:</strong> Physician-owned practices make their own purchasing decisions. Practice administrator or physician handles vendor relationships.</p>

        <p><strong>Hospital-employed:</strong> Purchasing goes through hospital supply chain. Physicians have limited direct purchasing authority.</p>

        <p><strong>Large physician groups:</strong> Multi-site groups often have centralized purchasing, operations teams, and corporate decision-makers.</p>

        <p><strong>FQHC (Federally Qualified Health Centers):</strong> Community health centers with unique funding, purchasing requirements, and administrative structures.</p>

        <p><strong>Urgent care:</strong> Walk-in focused, often corporate-owned chains. Centralized purchasing common.</p>

        <p><strong>Retail clinic:</strong> CVS MinuteClinic, Walgreens, etc. Corporate purchasing, standardized protocols.</p>

        <p><strong>Concierge/DPC:</strong> Direct primary care practices with different economics and often different product preferences.</p>

        <h2>What We Validate and Enrich</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>NPI verification.</strong> Every physician verified against the NPPES registry.</li>

          <li><strong>Specialty classification.</strong> Family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, etc.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice type.</strong> Independent, hospital-employed, group, FQHC, urgent care, etc.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice size.</strong> Number of providers, estimated patient panel size where available.</li>

          <li><strong>Location verification.</strong> Current practice address, multiple location flagging.</li>

          <li><strong>Decision-maker identification.</strong> Physician-owner, practice administrator, office manager.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Health System Affiliation Tracking</h2>

        <p>Primary care has rapidly consolidated into health systems. Understanding these affiliations is critical:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Health system ownership vs. affiliation</li>
          <li>ACO participation</li>
          <li>Clinically integrated network membership</li>
          <li>EHR platform (often system-wide)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We track major health system affiliations to help you understand which practices buy independently vs. through system contracts.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Per physician:</strong></p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you identify independent vs. hospital-employed?</h3>
          <p>Multiple signals: practice name patterns, NPI organization type, address matching to hospital systems, and manual verification for ambiguous cases.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify which EHR a practice uses?</h3>
          <p>We can often identify EHR platforms, especially for practices on major systems (Epic, Athenahealth, eClinicalWorks). Coverage varies by practice type.</p>

          <h3>Do you include nurse practitioners and PAs?</h3>
          <p>We can. Primary care increasingly relies on NPs and PAs, especially in FQHCs and urgent care. Let us know if you want them included.</p>

          <h3>What about practices that are both primary care and urgent care?</h3>
          <p>Common in retail and some group settings. We classify based on primary focus but flag hybrid models.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Navigate the Primary Care Market</h2>

        <p>Primary care is too large and varied for generic lists. We classify practices by type and structure so you can target the right physicians with the right approach.</p>
