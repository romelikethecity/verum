        <h2>Orthopedic Data Is High-Stakes</h2>

        <p>You're selling implants, instruments, or services to orthopedic surgeons. Average deal size is significant. Territory coverage matters. Every bad record represents real revenue opportunity lost.</p>

        <p>But orthopedic data is notoriously messy. Surgeons move between practices. Hospital employment arrangements change. Subspecialties get misclassified. Your hip surgeon list includes spine surgeons. Your list of private practice surgeons includes hospital employees.</p>

        <p>When a field rep shows up to call on a joint replacement surgeon and finds a hand specialist—or worse, someone who left six months ago—that's a wasted day in a territory that can't afford waste.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We had 200 orthopedic surgeons in our territory list. Turned out 30 had retired, 25 were hospital-employed now, and 40 were the wrong subspecialty. After cleanup, our reps finally had a list they could work."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Regional Sales Manager, Orthopedic Implant Company</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Validate</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>NPI verification.</strong> Every surgeon verified against the NPPES registry. Active license status confirmed.</li>

          <li><strong>Subspecialty classification.</strong> Joint replacement, spine, sports medicine, trauma, hand, foot/ankle, pediatric, oncology. Accurate subspecialty assignment.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice type.</strong> Private practice, hospital-employed, academic, ambulatory surgery center. Know who makes purchasing decisions.</li>

          <li><strong>Hospital affiliations.</strong> Which hospitals they operate at. IDN relationships that affect purchasing.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice location.</strong> Current address verified. Multiple locations identified.</li>

          <li><strong>Contact information.</strong> Office phone, email where available, practice manager contacts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Subspecialty Intelligence</h2>

        <p>Orthopedic surgeons aren't interchangeable. A spine surgeon doesn't buy knee implants. A hand specialist doesn't care about your hip system. Subspecialty accuracy is critical for targeting.</p>

        <p>We classify orthopedic surgeons into subspecialties based on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Fellowship training records</li>
          <li>Procedure volume data where available</li>
          <li>Practice website analysis</li>
          <li>Hospital credentialing information</li>
          <li>Professional society memberships</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The result: your total joint list actually contains total joint surgeons. Your spine list contains spine surgeons. Your targeting works.</p>

        <h2>Practice Type Matters</h2>

        <p>In orthopedics, practice type determines who you sell to:</p>

        <p><strong>Private practice:</strong> The surgeon (or practice administrator) makes purchasing decisions. Direct sales relationship.</p>

        <p><strong>Hospital-employed:</strong> Purchasing goes through hospital supply chain. Different sales motion, different contacts.</p>

        <p><strong>Academic:</strong> Complex purchasing with department heads, hospital administration, and physician preference cards.</p>

        <p><strong>ASC-based:</strong> Ambulatory surgery center ownership or affiliation changes the economics and decision-makers.</p>

        <p>We classify practice type so your sales team knows who they're actually selling to before they walk in the door.</p>

        <h2>New Practice and Surgeon Detection</h2>

        <p>New orthopedic practices are prime targets. They're making purchasing decisions, establishing vendor relationships, and haven't been overwhelmed by every other rep yet.</p>

        <p>We monitor for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>New orthopedic practice openings</li>
          <li>Surgeons leaving hospitals to start private practices</li>
          <li>New surgeons completing fellowship and entering practice</li>
          <li>Practice acquisitions and consolidations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Can you identify high-volume surgeons?</h3>
          <p>In some cases. CMS publishes procedure volume data for Medicare patients. We can enrich with this data where available, though it's not comprehensive.</p>

          <h3>Do you track ASC ownership?</h3>
          <p>We can identify surgeons who have ownership stakes in ASCs where this information is publicly available through state licensing or CMS records.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle surgeons at multiple locations?</h3>
          <p>We capture all practice locations for each surgeon. You can target based on primary location or include all locations in territory assignments.</p>

          <h3>What about physician assistants and nurse practitioners?</h3>
          <p>We can include orthopedic PAs and NPs if you need them. They have their own NPIs and we validate them the same way.</p>

        <h2>Get Orthopedic Data You Can Trust</h2>

        <p>Your orthopedic territory is too valuable for bad data. We validate and enrich your surgeon lists so your reps spend their time with the right targets.</p>
