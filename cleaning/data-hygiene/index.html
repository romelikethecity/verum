        <h2>Why Data Gets Dirty</h2>

        <p>Clean data doesn't stay clean. This is the frustrating reality that nobody mentions when you finish that big CRM cleanup project.</p>

        <p>People change jobs. Average tenure is under 3 years now, which means a third of your contacts will have different titles or companies within 12 months. Emails start bouncing. Phone numbers disconnect. The person you're trying to reach moved on, but your database doesn't know.</p>

        <p>New records enter with inconsistent formatting. One rep types "VP of Sales." Another types "Vice President, Sales." Someone imports a list with "VP Sales" in all caps. Now you have three different ways to say the same thing, and none of your automations work correctly.</p>

        <p>Duplicates breed. Every list import, every trade show, every webinar registration creates risk. Without matching, the same person appears multiple times. They get multiple emails. Their history fragments across records. Your biggest customer looks like three small ones.</p>

        <p>Data hygiene is the ongoing work of fighting entropy. Not a one-time project, but continuous maintenance.</p>

        <h2>What Data Hygiene Includes</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Email validation.</strong> Not just format checking. Actual verification against mail servers. Catch bounces before they happen.</li>

          <li><strong>Duplicate detection.</strong> Exact matches plus fuzzy matching. Find the records that are the same person despite different formatting.</li>

          <li><strong>Contact verification.</strong> Does this person still work at this company? Has their title changed? Are they still reachable?</li>

          <li><strong>Format standardization.</strong> Consistent phone formats, address structures, title conventions. Everything uniform.</li>

          <li><strong>Completeness monitoring.</strong> Which records are missing critical fields? What percentage of your database is actually usable?</li>

          <li><strong>Decay tracking.</strong> How fast is your data degrading? Where are the problems concentrated? What needs attention first?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>One-Time vs. Ongoing</h2>

        <p>We offer both approaches.</p>

        <p><strong>One-time deep clean.</strong> You've got years of accumulated mess. Bad data has been building up. You need a reset. We do a comprehensive cleanup: validate everything, merge duplicates, standardize formats, remove garbage. Start fresh with clean data.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing hygiene.</strong> After the deep clean, or if your data is already in decent shape, we maintain it. Monthly or quarterly passes that catch new problems before they compound. Much smaller scope, much lower cost, but continuous.</p>

        <p>Most organizations need the deep clean first. Years of neglect can't be fixed with light maintenance. But once you're clean, staying clean is straightforward.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data.</strong> Export from your CRM, marketing automation, or database. We accept any format.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess the damage.</strong> Duplicate rate, bounce rate, completeness score, decay patterns. You'll know exactly where you stand.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Cleaning and validation.</strong> Comprehensive hygiene pass addressing all identified issues.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Ambiguous duplicates, uncertain merges, questionable records. We don't guess.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Clean data delivered.</strong> Import-ready format with documentation of what changed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 6: Ongoing schedule (optional).</strong> Set up monthly or quarterly hygiene passes to maintain quality.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Data hygiene runs $0.02-0.05 per record for one-time projects. Ongoing maintenance is typically lower per record since we're only addressing new issues.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote based on your database size and current condition.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Data hygiene vs data cleaning?</h3>
          <p>Cleaning is a one-time fix. Hygiene is ongoing maintenance. You usually need a deep clean first, then regular hygiene to maintain it.</p>

          <h3>How often should we do this?</h3>
          <p>Depends on your data velocity. High-volume sales teams might need monthly. Slower databases can go quarterly. We'll recommend based on your decay rate.</p>

          <h3>What does hygiene actually involve?</h3>
          <p>Email validation, duplicate detection, format standardization, completeness checks, decay monitoring. The routine maintenance that keeps data usable.</p>

          <h3>Can we automate this internally?</h3>
          <p>Partially. CRM rules catch obvious issues. But they can't validate emails externally, find fuzzy duplicates, or verify employment. Internal tools catch some problems. Proper hygiene catches all of them.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready for Clean Data?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see the damage?</strong> Send us a sample. We'll run a health assessment and show you exactly what's wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to clean?</strong> Send us your full dataset. We'll return it healthy with hygiene documentation.</p>
