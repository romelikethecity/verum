        <h2>The Fragmented Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Your customer data lives in silos. CRM has contacts and deals. ERP has invoices and shipping. Support has tickets and satisfaction scores. Marketing has event registrations and email engagement. Each system has its own records, its own IDs, its own version of the truth.</p>

        <p>The same person exists in all of them. But "John Smith" in Salesforce and "J. Smith" in NetSuite and "john.smith@acme.com" in Zendesk don't obviously connect. Without matching, you can't answer basic questions. What's this customer's complete history? How much have they actually spent? When did they last have a support issue?</p>

        <p>The symptoms are everywhere. Sales doesn't know about open support tickets. Support doesn't know about pending renewals. Finance sees revenue that sales can't attribute. Customer 360 remains a dream because nobody can connect the dots.</p>

        <p>Manual matching doesn't scale. Somebody exports spreadsheets, does VLOOKUPs, eyeballs for matches. Works for 100 records. Falls apart at 10,000. Completely impossible at 100,000. You need systematic matching across every source.</p>

        <h2>How Record Matching Works</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Multi-field matching.</strong> Email, phone, name + company, address, LinkedIn URL. No single field is reliable alone, but multiple signals combined create confident matches.</li>

          <li><strong>Fuzzy matching.</strong> "John Smith" matches "Jon Smith" matches "J. Smith". "Acme Corp" matches "Acme Corporation". Variations don't break the match.</li>

          <li><strong>Cross-source linking.</strong> CRM record A links to ERP record B links to Support record C. You get a match key that connects them all.</li>

          <li><strong>Confidence scoring.</strong> High confidence: email exact match. Medium: name + company fuzzy match. Low: possible match, needs review. You see the basis for every match.</li>

          <li><strong>Golden record creation.</strong> Take the best data from each source. Most recent email from CRM, billing address from ERP, phone from support. One complete record.</li>

          <li><strong>Conflict identification.</strong> Source A says Chicago, Source B says New York. We flag it. You decide or set rules for which source wins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Matching vs Deduplication</h2>

        <p>These are related but different problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Deduplication</strong> finds duplicate records within a single dataset. Same person appearing twice in your CRM. One source, multiple records that should be one.</p>

        <p><strong>Record matching</strong> links records across multiple datasets. Same person appearing in CRM, ERP, and support system. Multiple sources, records that should connect.</p>

        <p>Most organizations need both. First deduplicate each source. Then match across sources. The combined result is one golden record per entity with links to all source records.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Match keys.</strong> A unique identifier linking related records across sources. "Match group 12345" connects CRM record A, ERP record B, and Support record C.</p>

        <p><strong>Confidence scores.</strong> How certain we are about each match. High confidence can auto-link. Lower confidence needs human review.</p>

        <p><strong>Match basis.</strong> What fields matched and how. "Email exact match" or "Name fuzzy + Company exact." You can see why we linked them.</p>

        <p><strong>Golden records (optional).</strong> If you want merged records, we create them. Best data from each source, conflicts resolved according to your rules.</p>

        <p><strong>Conflict report.</strong> Where sources disagree. You can resolve them manually or set automated rules.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data sources.</strong> Exports from each system. CRM, ERP, support, marketing automation, spreadsheets. Whatever you need connected.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Field mapping.</strong> We identify which fields to match on. Email, phone, name, company, address. You approve the matching strategy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Matching.</strong> Algorithms run across all sources. Exact matches first, then fuzzy. Each potential match scored.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Edge cases and low-confidence matches reviewed manually. Borderline decisions made by people, not algorithms.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Results delivered.</strong> Match keys, confidence scores, optional golden records. Ready to load into your master data system.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Record matching runs $0.03-0.08 per record, depending on the number of sources and matching complexity. Simple two-source email matching is lower. Complex multi-source fuzzy matching is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Most projects complete within 48 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Matching vs deduplication?</h3>
          <p>Deduplication finds duplicates within one dataset. Matching links records across multiple datasets. Different problems, both often needed.</p>

          <h3>How do you match without a common ID?</h3>
          <p>Multiple criteria: email, phone, name + company, address, LinkedIn URL. Weak signals combined into strong matches. Fuzzy matching catches variations.</p>

          <h3>What's a golden record?</h3>
          <p>The single best version created by combining the best data from each source. CRM email + ERP address + Support phone = one complete record.</p>

          <h3>What about conflicts?</h3>
          <p>We flag them. You set rules (most recent wins, certain source wins) or resolve manually. Conflicts identified clearly.</p>
