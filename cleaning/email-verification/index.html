        <h2>The Decay Reality</h2>

        <p>Email addresses die constantly. People change jobs, get promoted, move companies. Email domains get acquired or shut down. What was a valid address six months ago might bounce today.</p>

        <p>Industry data suggests about 30% of B2B email addresses become invalid within a year. That's nearly a third of your list going bad annually. A database you haven't touched in two years might have more dead addresses than live ones.</p>

        <p>The cost isn't just wasted sends. High bounce rates damage your sender reputation. Email providers watch how often your messages bounce. Cross a threshold and they start routing you to spam, or blocking you entirely. One bad campaign to an unverified list can hurt deliverability for months.</p>

        <p>Verification catches the dead addresses before they become bounces. Know what's valid before you send.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Email deliverability went from 72% to 94%."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Hansen, Marketing Director</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verification Works</h2>

        <p>Real email verification checks whether a mailbox exists, not just whether an address looks valid.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Domain check.</strong> Does the domain exist and resolve? Catches addresses at defunct or fake domains.</li>

          <li><strong>MX record lookup.</strong> Does the domain have mail servers configured? Some domains exist but don't receive email.</li>

          <li><strong>SMTP connection.</strong> Can we connect to the mail server? Confirms the infrastructure is working.</li>

          <li><strong>Mailbox verification.</strong> Does this specific mailbox exist? We ask the server directly without sending a message.</li>

          <li><strong>Response analysis.</strong> What does the server tell us? "User unknown" means invalid. "OK" means valid. Other responses need interpretation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Catch-All Challenge</h2>

        <p>Some organizations configure their mail servers as "catch-all." These servers accept all mail regardless of whether the specific mailbox exists. The mail goes to a central inbox or gets discarded later, but the server doesn't reject it during SMTP verification.</p>

        <p>This makes verification uncertain for those domains. The server says "yes" to every address, even fake ones. We identify catch-all domains and flag those addresses separately so you know which results are definitive and which are uncertain.</p>

        <p>Microsoft 365 and some Google Workspace configurations also block verification requests, returning inconclusive results. We handle these carefully, using additional signals when available.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Verified addresses.</strong> Mailbox confirmed to exist. Safe to email.</p>

        <p><strong>Invalid addresses.</strong> Mailbox confirmed not to exist. Will bounce.</p>

        <p><strong>Uncertain addresses.</strong> Catch-all domains or blocked verification. May or may not work.</p>

        <p><strong>Risk flags.</strong> Disposable domains, role addresses, other warning signs.</p>

        <p><strong>Full statistics.</strong> Valid rate, invalid rate, uncertain rate. Complete picture of your list quality.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your emails.</strong> List of addresses to verify. Any format.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We run SMTP verification.</strong> Full verification sequence on each address.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Results categorized.</strong> Verified, invalid, uncertain. Each address classified with reasons.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Report delivered.</strong> Complete verification results with statistics.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Email verification runs $0.01-0.03 per address, depending on volume. Larger lists get better rates.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Most lists are verified within 24 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Validation vs verification?</h3>
          <p>Often interchangeable. Technically, validation checks format; verification confirms existence. Good email checking does both.</p>

          <h3>How does SMTP verification work?</h3>
          <p>We connect to the mail server and ask if the mailbox exists, then disconnect before actually sending. Confirms deliverability without test emails.</p>

          <h3>What about catch-all domains?</h3>
          <p>They accept all mail regardless of mailbox existence. We can't definitively verify these addresses, so we flag them separately.</p>

          <h3>How accurate is verification?</h3>
          <p>93%+ on most lists. Some providers block verification requests, making those addresses harder to confirm. We mark uncertain results clearly.</p>

        <h2>Ready to Verify Your Emails?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see your invalid rate?</strong> Send us a sample. We'll verify it and show you the results.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to verify everything?</strong> Send us your full list. We'll return verification status on every address.</p>
