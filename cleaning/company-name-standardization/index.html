        <h2>The Company Name Problem</h2>

        <p>Company names are entered by humans. Humans are inconsistent. One rep types "Acme Corp." Another types "Acme Corporation." A third imports a list with "ACME CO." Now you have three records for one company.</p>

        <p>This isn't just a cosmetic issue. Fragmented records mean fragmented customer history. Your big account looks like three small accounts. Revenue attribution is wrong. Your top-accounts report is inaccurate. The VP asks "how much business do we do with Acme?" and nobody can answer confidently.</p>

        <p>Company name standardization brings all variations to one consistent format. Now deduplication works. Now reporting is accurate. Now you can actually see your customer relationships clearly.</p>

        <h2>What We Standardize</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Legal suffix normalization.</strong> Inc, Inc., Incorporated, Corp, Corp., Corporation, Co, Co., Company, LLC, L.L.C., Ltd, Limited. All brought to your preferred format.</li>

          <li><strong>Punctuation cleanup.</strong> Periods, commas, extra spaces, inconsistent capitalization. Everything cleaned to a consistent style.</li>

          <li><strong>Abbreviation handling.</strong> "Int'l" becomes "International." "Mfg" becomes "Manufacturing." Common abbreviations expanded or standardized.</li>

          <li><strong>Typo correction.</strong> Common misspellings caught and fixed. "Microsft" becomes "Microsoft." "Amazo" becomes "Amazon."</li>

          <li><strong>DBA/trading name alignment.</strong> Some records use legal names, others use trading names. We note the relationship and standardize consistently.</li>

          <li><strong>Capitalization standardization.</strong> "ACME CORPORATION" and "acme corporation" both become "Acme Corporation."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Standardization Enables Everything Else</h2>

        <p>Standardization is foundation work. Until company names are consistent, other data operations fail.</p>

        <p><strong>Deduplication.</strong> You can't find duplicates if the same company appears as three different text strings. Standardization makes matching possible.</p>

        <p><strong>Data enrichment.</strong> Appending data from external sources requires matching. "Acme Corp" might not match their database's "Acme Corporation."</p>

        <p><strong>Reporting.</strong> Roll-up reports, territory analysis, account tiering. All depend on consistent names to group records correctly.</p>

        <p><strong>Integration.</strong> Syncing between systems fails when names don't match. Standardization enables clean integration.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Export from your CRM, database, or spreadsheet. Any format.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze the variations.</strong> Identifying all the different ways the same companies appear in your data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Standardization rules applied.</strong> Consistent format across all records based on your preferences.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Clean names delivered.</strong> Original name preserved, standardized name added. Ready for deduplication and reporting.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Company name standardization runs $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on volume and complexity. Basic suffix and format standardization is lower. Full cleaning with typo correction and DBA alignment is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote based on your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What variations do you standardize?</h3>
          <p>Legal suffixes (Inc, Corp, LLC, Ltd), punctuation, spacing, capitalization, abbreviations, typos, and DBA names.</p>

          <h3>What about subsidiaries and parent companies?</h3>
          <p>That's a separate service (parent-subsidiary mapping). Standardization focuses on making the name itself consistent.</p>

          <h3>What about multiple legal names?</h3>
          <p>Some companies have multiple legitimate names. We note when this occurs while standardizing to your chosen format.</p>

          <h3>Do you preserve original names?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We add a standardized field rather than overwriting. You keep your original data for reference.</p>
