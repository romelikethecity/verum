        <h2>The Variation Problem</h2>

        <p>Data entered by humans is inconsistent. This isn't a failure of training or discipline. It's just reality.</p>

        <p>Someone types "VP of Sales." Another types "Vice President, Sales." A third imports a list with "VP Sales" and no punctuation. All three mean the same thing. But to your database, they're three different values. Your "VP" segment only includes one of them. Your reports show three separate categories. Your automations trigger inconsistently.</p>

        <p>Phone numbers arrive in a dozen formats. (555) 123-4567. 555.123.4567. 5551234567. +1 555 123 4567. All valid, all representing the same number, all completely different to a computer.</p>

        <p>Dates are even worse if you have international data. 01/02/2024 could be January 2nd or February 1st depending on who entered it. There's no way to know without context.</p>

        <p>Company names, addresses, industries, states, countries. Every field where humans type instead of select has this problem. And it compounds. A database with a few years of accumulated data might have hundreds of variations for common values.</p>

        <h2>What We Normalize</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Job titles.</strong> Map hundreds of variations to standard categories. VP Sales, Vice President of Sales, VP - Sales, Sales VP. All become one normalized value.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone numbers.</strong> Consistent format: +1 (555) 123-4567 or whatever pattern you prefer. Country codes added, formatting unified.</li>

          <li><strong>Dates.</strong> ISO format (2024-01-15) or your preferred standard. Ambiguous dates resolved through context.</li>

          <li><strong>Addresses.</strong> Street, city, state, ZIP in consistent formats. "St." vs "Street" vs "Str" unified. State abbreviations standardized.</li>

          <li><strong>Company names.</strong> "Acme Corp" and "Acme Corporation" become one standard format. Legal suffixes handled consistently.</li>

          <li><strong>Industries.</strong> Free-text industry fields mapped to standard classifications (NAICS, SIC, or custom taxonomy).</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic values.</strong> State and country names standardized. "California" and "CA" unified. "United States" and "USA" unified.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Normalization Matters</h2>

        <p><strong>Accurate reporting.</strong> If "VP Sales" and "Vice President, Sales" aren't grouped together, your VP segment is incomplete. Normalization makes reporting reflect reality.</p>

        <p><strong>Deduplication.</strong> You can't find duplicates if the same data is formatted differently. Normalizing first makes matching possible.</p>

        <p><strong>Automation.</strong> Lead routing, segmentation, scoring. All depend on consistent values. Variations break rules.</p>

        <p><strong>Integration.</strong> Syncing between systems fails when formats don't match. Normalizing enables clean data flow.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data.</strong> Any format. Export from your CRM, database, or spreadsheet.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze variations.</strong> Cataloging all the different ways the same values appear in your data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Mapping and normalization.</strong> Creating transformation rules and applying them across your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human review.</strong> Edge cases and ambiguous mappings get manual verification.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Normalized data delivered.</strong> Original values preserved, normalized columns added. Ready for use.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Data normalization runs $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on how many fields need normalization and how messy they are. Simple phone formatting is lower. Complex multi-field normalization with custom taxonomies is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote based on your specific requirements.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Normalization vs standardization?</h3>
          <p>Terms are often used interchangeably. Technically, normalization restructures data; standardization applies consistent formats. Most projects need both.</p>

          <h3>What fields need normalization?</h3>
          <p>Any field with free text: job titles, phone numbers, dates, addresses, company names, industries, states, countries. Basically anything humans type.</p>

          <h3>Why not just use Excel formulas?</h3>
          <p>Works for simple cases. But real normalization requires fuzzy matching and reference databases. "VP, Sales" and "Vice President of Sales" are the same. Excel won't catch that.</p>

          <h3>Do you preserve original values?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We add normalized columns, not overwrite. Your original data stays intact for reference.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready for Consistent Data?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see the variations?</strong> Send us a sample. We'll catalog the inconsistencies and show you what normalization fixes.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to normalize?</strong> Send us your full dataset. We'll return it clean with consistent formats throughout.</p>
