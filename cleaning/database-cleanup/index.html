        <h2>The Accumulated Mess</h2>

        <p>Databases don't start messy. They get that way over time.</p>

        <p>Year one is fine. Year two, a few problems creep in. By year five, you've got duplicates everywhere, thousands of bouncing emails, formatting inconsistencies that break every report, and records that might have been valid once but aren't anymore.</p>

        <p>How does it get this bad? List imports without proper deduplication. Reps entering data inconsistently. Contacts changing jobs but records staying frozen. Systems syncing the same person with slightly different information. Every year adds another layer of mess on top of the last one.</p>

        <p>Eventually, trust in the data collapses. Teams start maintaining their own spreadsheets. Campaigns go out to people who haven't worked at those companies for years. Reporting shows numbers nobody believes. The database becomes a liability instead of an asset.</p>

        <p>A full cleanup resets everything. Address all the problems at once, get back to clean, and then maintain it going forward.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What Full Cleanup Includes</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Duplicate detection and merge.</strong> Find duplicates by email, by name + company, by phone. Exact matches and fuzzy matches. Merge records keeping the best data from each.</li>

          <li><strong>Email validation.</strong> Every email verified against mail servers. Bounces, spam traps, and invalid addresses identified before they hurt deliverability.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone standardization.</strong> Consistent formatting across all phone numbers. Country codes added where missing. Invalid numbers flagged.</li>

          <li><strong>Address normalization.</strong> Street, city, state, ZIP in consistent formats. Validation against postal databases. Undeliverable addresses flagged.</li>

          <li><strong>Field normalization.</strong> Job titles, company names, industries, states, countries. All brought to consistent formats.</li>

          <li><strong>Completeness analysis.</strong> Which records are missing critical fields? What percentage of your database is actually usable? Full visibility into data quality.</li>

          <li><strong>Invalid record removal.</strong> Clearly bad records separated out. You decide what to delete, keep, or investigate further.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Get Back</h2>

        <p><strong>Clean, import-ready data.</strong> Your original record IDs preserved. Standardized formats throughout. Ready to load back into your system.</p>

        <p><strong>Separate files for review.</strong> Potential duplicates that need human judgment. Invalid records that might be recoverable. Edge cases that weren't clear-cut.</p>

        <p><strong>Quality report.</strong> Before-and-after statistics. Duplicate rate reduction. Email validity improvement. Format standardization coverage. You can see exactly what changed.</p>

        <p><strong>Change log.</strong> Every modification documented. What was merged, what was fixed, what was flagged. Full audit trail of the cleanup.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your database.</strong> Contacts, accounts, leads. Whatever needs cleaning. Any format you can export.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess the damage.</strong> Duplicate rate, invalid rate, completeness score. You'll know exactly how bad it is.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Comprehensive cleanup.</strong> All identified issues addressed. Duplicates merged, emails validated, formats standardized.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Edge cases reviewed manually. We don't make automated decisions on ambiguous situations.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Clean data delivered.</strong> Import-ready files with documentation. Guidance on how to load it back.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Full database cleanup runs $0.03-0.08 per record, depending on database size and condition. Simple cleanup (less mess, fewer issues) is lower. Complex cleanup (years of accumulation, multiple problem types) is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What does cleanup include?</h3>
          <p>Duplicate detection, email validation, phone formatting, address standardization, field normalization, completeness analysis. Everything needed to fix accumulated problems.</p>

          <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
          <p>24-48 hours for most projects. Larger databases (100K+) might take 3-5 days. Complex situations with extensive review can extend that.</p>

          <h3>Will I lose data?</h3>
          <p>No. We never delete without approval. Duplicates are flagged for review. Invalid records go to a separate file. You decide what to keep.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean any database?</h3>
          <p>If you can export it, we can clean it. Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, MySQL, Excel, CSV. We work with your export, not directly in your system.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready for a Clean Database?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see the damage?</strong> Export a sample and send it to us. We'll assess it and show you exactly what's wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to clean?</strong> Export your full database. We'll return it clean with full documentation.</p>
