        <h2>The Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Everyone knows their data isn't perfect. But how bad is it, exactly? Most organizations can't answer that question. They have a vague sense that things could be better, but no concrete measurement. No baseline. No way to track improvement.</p>

        <p>Without measurement, you can't prioritize. Is the duplicate problem worse than the missing email problem? Should you focus on contact accuracy or completeness? Where will fixing data have the biggest business impact?</p>

        <p>And without ongoing monitoring, fixes don't stick. You clean your database, declare victory, and six months later you're back where you started. New bad data has accumulated. The same problems have returned. All that effort, and you're running on a treadmill.</p>

        <p>Data quality management is the discipline of measuring, fixing, and maintaining. Not a one-time project, but an ongoing program.</p>

        <h2>Three Components</h2>

        <h3>Assessment</h3>

        <p>You need to know where you stand before you can improve. We measure data quality across four dimensions:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Completeness.</strong> What percentage of fields are populated? How many records are missing emails? Phone numbers? Job titles?</li>

          <li><strong>Accuracy.</strong> Of the populated fields, how many are verifiably correct? Do emails actually deliver? Do people still work at listed companies?</li>

          <li><strong>Consistency.</strong> Do formats match across records? Are there variations that should be unified? Duplicates that should be merged?</li>

          <li><strong>Validity.</strong> Do values fall within expected ranges? Are phone numbers the right length? Are dates in sensible ranges?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You get a score for each dimension plus an overall health rating. Now you know exactly where you stand.</p>

        <h3>Remediation</h3>

        <p>Assessment identifies problems. Remediation fixes them. This is the actual cleaning work: validating emails, merging duplicates, filling missing fields, standardizing formats.</p>

        <p>We prioritize based on business impact. Fields that affect revenue attribution get fixed first. Data quality issues that break automations get priority. Not everything needs fixing, and not everything needs fixing immediately.</p>

        <h3>Monitoring</h3>

        <p>After remediation, ongoing monitoring tracks quality over time. Are new records meeting standards? Is decay accumulating? Have new problem patterns emerged?</p>

        <p>Monthly or quarterly health checks catch issues before they compound. Much easier to fix 500 bad records than 50,000.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Initial assessment.</strong> Send us your data. We measure quality across all four dimensions and deliver a comprehensive health report.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Prioritization.</strong> Based on assessment results and your business goals, we identify what to fix first.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Remediation.</strong> Systematic fixing of identified issues. Cleaning, validation, standardization, deduplication.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Re-assessment.</strong> After remediation, we measure again. See the improvement quantified.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Monitoring program.</strong> Ongoing health checks at whatever cadence makes sense for your data velocity.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Quality assessment runs $500-1,000 depending on database size and complexity. Remediation pricing depends on what needs fixing: $0.02-0.05 per record for cleaning, more for enrichment.</p>

        <p>Ongoing monitoring programs are priced based on frequency and scope. We'll quote after the initial assessment when we understand your needs.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What does quality management include?</h3>
          <p>Three components: Assessment (measuring current quality), Remediation (fixing problems), and Monitoring (tracking quality over time). Most organizations need all three.</p>

          <h3>How do you measure quality?</h3>
          <p>Four dimensions: Completeness, Accuracy, Consistency, and Validity. We score each and provide an overall health rating.</p>

          <h3>What's a typical score?</h3>
          <p>Most databases score 45-65% initially. After remediation, 85-95% is typical. Perfect 100% isn't realistic, but high quality is achievable.</p>

          <h3>Ongoing management or one-time fix?</h3>
          <p>Depends on your data velocity. Constant new records need ongoing management. Static databases might only need periodic health checks.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Measure and Improve?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to know your score?</strong> Send us a sample. We'll run a health assessment and show you exactly where you stand.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready for full management?</strong> Let's talk about your data quality goals and build a program to achieve them.</p>
