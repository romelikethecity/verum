        <h2>The Title Chaos Problem</h2>

        <p>Job titles are creative expressions, not data points. Every company invents their own, and nobody coordinates with anyone else.</p>

        <p>You've got "VP Sales" and "Vice President of Sales" and "VP, Sales" and "Sales VP" and "Vice Pres Sales" in the same database. They're all the same seniority level, but your CRM treats them as different segments. Your "target VPs" campaign misses half of them.</p>

        <p>Then there's the seniority problem. "Director" at a 50-person startup might be more senior than "VP" at a 10,000-person enterprise. "Senior Manager" could be one level below director or three levels below. The title alone doesn't tell you who has budget authority.</p>

        <p>And let's not forget the creative titles. "Growth Hacker" is probably marketing. "Revenue Operations Lead" is probably sales ops. "Chief Happiness Officer" could be HR or it could be the founder's golden retriever. Without normalization, these contacts slip through every filter you build.</p>

        <p>The cost is bad targeting. Campaigns that miss decision-makers. Sequences that treat directors like individual contributors. Territory assignments based on title strings instead of actual seniority. Every downstream process inherits the chaos.</p>

        <h2>What Title Normalization Includes</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Seniority classification.</strong> C-Suite, VP, Director, Manager, Individual Contributor. Standard levels that work for any company size.</li>

          <li><strong>Department mapping.</strong> Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Finance, HR, Operations, IT, Legal, Executive. Know what function each person owns.</li>

          <li><strong>Standardized titles.</strong> Group variations under canonical titles. All 47 versions of "VP of Sales" become one segment.</li>

          <li><strong>Context-aware classification.</strong> Company size and industry inform seniority interpretation. Director at a startup vs enterprise.</li>

          <li><strong>Creative title handling.</strong> Map non-traditional titles to standard functions. "Growth Ninja" becomes Marketing, Individual Contributor.</li>

          <li><strong>Abbreviation expansion.</strong> "Mgr" to Manager, "Engr" to Engineer, "Mktg" to Marketing. All the shortcuts resolved.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Classification Framework</h2>

        <p>We use a two-dimensional classification: seniority level and department function. This gives you maximum flexibility for segmentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Seniority levels:</strong></p>
        <p>C-Suite (CEO, CFO, CTO, etc.), Executive (VP, SVP, EVP), Director (Director, Senior Director), Manager (Manager, Senior Manager), Individual Contributor (Analyst, Specialist, Associate, Coordinator).</p>

        <p><strong>Department functions:</strong></p>
        <p>Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Product, Finance, HR, Operations, IT, Legal, Executive/Admin, Customer Success, Data/Analytics.</p>

        <p>Every title gets both classifications. "Senior Director of Product Marketing" becomes Director + Marketing. "VP Engineering" becomes Executive + Engineering. You can filter by either dimension or both.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Three new fields per record.</strong> Seniority level, department function, and standardized title. Ready to import back to your CRM.</p>

        <p><strong>Confidence scores.</strong> High confidence means clear classification. Lower confidence means the title was ambiguous. You can see which ones we're certain about.</p>

        <p><strong>Original preservation.</strong> We don't overwrite your original titles. You get new fields alongside the existing data.</p>

        <p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Distribution by seniority, distribution by department. Know what your database actually contains.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your titles.</strong> Export from your CRM. Include company size if you have it for better seniority context.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: AI classification.</strong> Our algorithms handle the straightforward titles. About 85% classify with high confidence.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human review.</strong> Unusual titles, ambiguous abbreviations, and non-English titles get manual classification.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Normalized data delivered.</strong> Three new columns, confidence scores, ready to import.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Job title normalization runs $0.01-0.02 per record, depending on volume. Larger lists get better rates.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Most lists normalize within 24 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why do titles need normalization?</h3>
          <p>There are 500+ ways to write "VP of Sales." Without normalization, your segmentation misses half your targets and your reporting is meaningless.</p>

          <h3>What outputs do I get?</h3>
          <p>Three fields: seniority level (C-Suite through IC), department function (Sales, Marketing, etc.), and standardized title. Plus confidence scores.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle weird titles?</h3>
          <p>Context clues: company size, industry, title structure. "Growth Ninja" at a startup is probably marketing IC. Ambiguous cases get human review.</p>

          <h3>How accurate is it?</h3>
          <p>95%+ on seniority classification. AI handles 85% with high confidence; humans review the rest.</p>
