        <h2>The CRM Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Every CRM starts clean. Then reality happens.</p>

        <p>Reps enter data inconsistently. Lists get imported without deduplication. Contacts change jobs but records don't get updated. Integrations create duplicate records. Marketing and sales enter the same person from different sources. Five years later, your CRM is a mess.</p>

        <p>The symptoms are everywhere. Reps waste time researching contacts that don't exist anymore. Marketing emails bounce. Reporting is unreliable because the same account appears multiple times. Lead routing breaks because territory assignments don't match inconsistent data.</p>

        <p>Validity research shows workers spend 13+ hours per week dealing with CRM data quality issues. That's a quarter of someone's capacity lost to bad data.</p>

        <h2>What We Clean</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Duplicate detection and merge.</strong> Find duplicates by email, name + company, phone. Merge records keeping the best data from each.</li>

          <li><strong>Email validation.</strong> Identify bounces, spam traps, and invalid addresses. Flag or remove before they hurt deliverability.</li>

          <li><strong>Contact verification.</strong> Check if people still work where your CRM says. Flag job changes and departed contacts.</li>

          <li><strong>Field standardization.</strong> Consistent formats for names, companies, phones, addresses. No more "Corp" vs "Corporation" variations.</li>

          <li><strong>Data completeness.</strong> Identify records missing critical fields. Prioritize for enrichment or removal.</li>

          <li><strong>Picklist cleanup.</strong> Standardize industry, state, country, and other picklist values to your allowed options.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your CRM data.</strong> Contacts, accounts, leads. Whatever objects need cleaning. We'll guide you on what to export.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and clean.</strong> Finding all the issues and fixing them according to your rules.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Ambiguous duplicates, uncertain merges, and complex situations get manual review.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Clean data delivered.</strong> Import-ready file with record IDs preserved. Guidance on how to update your CRM.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>CRM data cleaning runs $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on what cleaning you need. Email validation only is lower. Full cleaning with deduplication, standardization, and verification is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote based on your record count and data quality.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Which CRMs do you work with?</h3>
          <p>All of them. Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, Pipedrive, Zoho, and any system that exports data. Export, we clean, you import.</p>

          <h3>How bad is typical CRM data?</h3>
          <p>Worse than you think. 10-30% duplicate rates are common. 30% of contacts decay annually. Most CRMs have years of accumulated mess.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean without exporting?</h3>
          <p>For Salesforce and HubSpot, we can connect directly on larger projects. For most customers, export/import gives you more control.</p>

          <h3>How do I get clean data back in?</h3>
          <p>We provide import-ready files with record IDs preserved. Most CRMs have update/upsert functionality. We'll guide you.</p>
        </div>
