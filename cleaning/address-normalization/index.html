        <h2>The Address Mess</h2>

        <p>Addresses are deceptively complex. People enter them differently. Systems store them differently. Over time, your database accumulates every possible variation.</p>

        <p>Some records have "Street" spelled out. Others use "St." or just "St" without the period. Some have directional prefixes (N, North, N.). Some have unit numbers in the street field, others in a separate field. ZIP codes might be 5 digits or 9. State might be spelled out or abbreviated.</p>

        <p>This inconsistency breaks things. Deduplication fails because "123 N Main St" doesn't match "123 North Main Street." Territory assignments misfire. Direct mail gets returned. Location-based analytics are unreliable.</p>

        <p>Address normalization brings everything to a consistent standard. Same format, same structure, same abbreviations. Now your data works.</p>

        <h2>What We Normalize</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Street type standardization.</strong> Street, St, St., Str all become one consistent format. Same for Avenue, Boulevard, Drive, and every other type.</li>

          <li><strong>Directional prefix handling.</strong> North, N, N. standardized. Same for South, East, West, and combinations like Northwest or NE.</li>

          <li><strong>Unit and suite normalization.</strong> Apt, Apt., Apartment, Unit, Ste, Suite, #. All standardized and properly positioned.</li>

          <li><strong>City name correction.</strong> Typos fixed, abbreviations expanded, proper capitalization applied.</li>

          <li><strong>State standardization.</strong> All converted to standard 2-letter abbreviations (or spelled out, your preference).</li>

          <li><strong>ZIP code formatting.</strong> 5-digit or ZIP+4, properly formatted. Missing leading zeros restored.</li>

          <li><strong>Field parsing.</strong> Addresses stuck in a single field get properly separated into street, city, state, ZIP components.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Validation Beyond Formatting</h2>

        <p>Normalization is about format. Validation is about accuracy. We do both.</p>

        <p>After normalizing, we validate against USPS databases. Does this address exist? Is it deliverable? Is the ZIP code correct for this city and state combination? This catches typos that look plausible but don't actually exist.</p>

        <p>Invalid addresses get flagged with specific reasons: undeliverable, incomplete, possible typo. You decide what to do with them.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data.</strong> Addresses in whatever format you have them. Single field, multiple fields, complete mess. We've seen it all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze the variations.</strong> Understanding your specific inconsistencies and the best normalization approach.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Normalization and validation.</strong> Standardizing formats and validating against postal databases.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Clean addresses delivered.</strong> Consistent formats with validation flags. Ready to use.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Address normalization runs $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on volume and whether you need USPS validation. Basic format standardization is lower. Full validation with deliverability checking is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote based on your data complexity.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What does normalization include?</h3>
          <p>Street type, directional prefix, unit, city, state, and ZIP standardization. Plus field parsing if addresses are in a single field.</p>

          <h3>Do you validate deliverability?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate against USPS databases and flag addresses that don't match known delivery points.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle international addresses?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We normalize to each country's standard format. Strongest coverage for US, Canada, UK, and EU.</p>

          <h3>Single field or parsed fields?</h3>
          <p>Either. We parse single-field addresses or standardize existing parsed fields. You get clean, structured data either way.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready for Clean Addresses?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see the difference?</strong> Send us a sample. We'll normalize it and show you the before-and-after.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to clean?</strong> Send us your full file. We'll return standardized, validated addresses.</p>
