        <h2>The Reality Gap</h2>

        <p>Data can be well-formatted and completely useless. The email looks valid, with proper syntax and a real domain. But the mailbox doesn't exist. The phone number has the right digits in the right places. But it's disconnected. The address follows all the rules. But there's no such location.</p>

        <p>Format validation only checks structure. Real validation checks reality. Does this email actually receive mail? Does this phone actually ring? Does this address actually exist?</p>

        <p>The gap between what looks valid and what is valid can be enormous. We've seen databases where 40% of emails look fine but bounce when you actually send to them. Purchased lists are often worse. Event registrations include typos and fake entries.</p>

        <p>And the cost of not validating hits you multiple ways. Bounced emails hurt your sender reputation. Disconnected phones waste sales time. Bad addresses mean returned mail. You're paying to reach people you can't actually reach.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Email deliverability went from 72% to 94%."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Hansen, Marketing Director</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Validate</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Email validation.</strong> DNS verification, MX record check, SMTP verification, mailbox existence confirmation. We verify the address can actually receive mail.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone validation.</strong> Format verification, carrier lookup, line type identification (mobile vs landline vs VoIP), connection status.</li>

          <li><strong>Address validation.</strong> USPS database verification, deliverability check, geocoding. We confirm the address exists and can receive mail or packages.</li>

          <li><strong>Domain validation.</strong> Is the company domain still active? Has it been acquired or shut down? Does the website still resolve?</li>

          <li><strong>Completeness validation.</strong> Are required fields populated? Are values in expected ranges? Do related fields make sense together?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Validation Before Action</h2>

        <p><strong>Protect your sender reputation.</strong> Too many bounces and email providers start blocking you. Validation removes bounces before they happen.</p>

        <p><strong>Stop wasting sales time.</strong> Every disconnected number is a dead-end call. Every wrong address is a wasted trip. Validation focuses effort on reachable contacts.</p>

        <p><strong>Improve campaign economics.</strong> You pay per email sent, per call made, per piece mailed. Why pay to reach nobody? Validation improves ROI by removing waste.</p>

        <p><strong>Make better decisions.</strong> Contact quality is a signal. If most data for an account is invalid, maybe that account isn't worth pursuing. Validation provides intelligence, not just cleanup.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data.</strong> Contacts, accounts, leads. Whatever needs validation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We run validation checks.</strong> Each relevant field verified against external sources.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Results categorized.</strong> Valid, invalid, uncertain, unreachable. Each record classified with specific reasons.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human review on edge cases.</strong> Uncertain results get manual verification where possible.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Clean data delivered.</strong> Validation flags included. Keep valid, remove invalid, investigate uncertain.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Data validation runs $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on what fields need validation. Email validation only is lower. Full multi-field validation (email + phone + address) is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote based on your volume and validation requirements.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What does validation include?</h3>
          <p>Checking whether data is real: emails receive mail, phones connect, addresses exist. Different from format checking. Validation tests reality.</p>

          <h3>How do you validate emails without sending?</h3>
          <p>DNS records, MX server verification, SMTP checks to confirm mailboxes exist. Catches most invalid addresses without actually mailing.</p>

          <h3>What's a typical invalid rate?</h3>
          <p>Purchased lists: 20-40%. Databases over 2 years old: 30%+. Event registrations: 5-15%. Most organizations are surprised how much doesn't validate.</p>

          <h3>Before or after cleaning?</h3>
          <p>Usually during. Validation results inform cleaning decisions. Integrated approach works best.</p>

        <h2>Ready to Know What's Real?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see your invalid rate?</strong> Send us a sample. We'll validate it and show you exactly what percentage passes.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to validate everything?</strong> Send us your full dataset. We'll return it with validation status on every record.</p>
