        <h2>The Duplicate Problem</h2>

        <p>Duplicates don't announce themselves. They creep in quietly and multiply over time.</p>

        <p>Marketing imports an event list without checking for existing records. Sales manually creates a contact who already exists under a slightly different name. Two systems sync the same person with different email formats. A company gets acquired and now appears under both old and new names.</p>

        <p>Simple duplicate rules catch some of these. If two records have the exact same email, most CRMs will flag them. But that misses the harder cases. "John Smith" and "Jon Smith" at the same company. "john.smith@acme.com" as a contact and "jsmith@acme.com" as a lead. Same person, different text, no automatic match.</p>

        <p>The consequences compound. Customer history fragments across records. The same person gets multiple marketing emails. Account-based reports show incorrect numbers because accounts appear multiple times. Revenue attribution breaks. And the duplicate rate keeps growing because nobody's catching new ones as they enter.</p>

        <h2>How We Detect Duplicates</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Exact email matching.</strong> The simplest case. Same email address = same person. Catches the obvious duplicates.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone number matching.</strong> Same phone across records, even with different formatting. (555) 123-4567 matches 5551234567.</li>

          <li><strong>Fuzzy name matching.</strong> "John Smith" vs "Jon Smith" vs "J. Smith." Catches typos, nicknames, and abbreviations.</li>

          <li><strong>Company name matching.</strong> "Acme Corporation" vs "Acme Corp" vs "ACME." Same company, different text representations.</li>

          <li><strong>Multi-field combination.</strong> Name + company, name + domain, phone + company. Multiple signals combined for higher confidence.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn URL matching.</strong> Same LinkedIn profile = same person. Often catches duplicates that other methods miss.</li>

          <li><strong>Cross-object detection.</strong> Same person appearing as both Lead and Contact. Same company as multiple Accounts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Detection vs Deduplication</h2>

        <p>These are two separate steps, and you might want one or both.</p>

        <p><strong>Detection</strong> finds duplicates. You get a report showing which records match, confidence scores for each match, and groupings of related records. No changes to your data.</p>

        <p><strong>Deduplication</strong> merges duplicates. After you review the matches and approve, we combine duplicate records into single records, keeping the best data from each source.</p>

        <p>Some organizations want detection only. They prefer to review matches manually and make merge decisions themselves. Others want the full process: find them and merge them. We do either.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Duplicate report.</strong> Every detected duplicate set with confidence scores. High confidence (95%+) means almost certainly the same record. Lower confidence means probable match, review recommended.</p>

        <p><strong>Match details.</strong> For each duplicate set, which fields matched and how. Email exact match, name fuzzy match at 87% similarity, same phone number. You can see why we think they're duplicates.</p>

        <p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Overall duplicate rate, breakdown by match type, distribution by confidence level. Know the scope of your problem.</p>

        <p><strong>Recommendations.</strong> Which matches are safe to auto-merge, which need human review, which might be false positives.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data.</strong> Export contacts, accounts, leads. Whatever you want to check for duplicates.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We run detection.</strong> Multiple matching algorithms across relevant fields. All potential duplicates identified.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Confidence scoring.</strong> Each match scored based on match quality. High confidence, medium, needs review.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Report delivered.</strong> Full duplicate analysis with recommendations. You review and decide next steps.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Merge (optional).</strong> If you want us to merge, we do. If you prefer to merge yourself, we provide guidance.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Duplicate detection runs $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on volume and matching complexity. Simple email-only matching is lower. Full fuzzy matching across multiple fields is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote based on your data size and requirements.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Exact vs fuzzy detection?</h3>
          <p>Exact finds identical values (same email). Fuzzy finds probable matches despite differences ("John Smith" vs "Jon Smith"). Most databases need both.</p>

          <h3>What fields do you match on?</h3>
          <p>Email, phone, name + company, LinkedIn URL, and custom fields if relevant. Multiple fields combined for confident matching.</p>

          <h3>What's a typical duplicate rate?</h3>
          <p>10-30% is common. We've seen 40%+ in databases with years of list imports without proper matching.</p>

          <h3>Detection vs deduplication?</h3>
          <p>Detection finds them. Deduplication merges them. Detection is step one; deduplication is step two. You can do one or both.</p>
