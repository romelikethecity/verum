        <h2>The List Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You have a contact list. Maybe purchased, maybe from an event, maybe exported from an old system. You want to email it or import it to your CRM. The temptation is to just load it and go.</p>

        <p>Don't. That list is almost certainly dirtier than it looks.</p>

        <p>Purchased lists often have 20-40% bad emails. Event lists have typos from badge scanners and handwritten forms. Old system exports have formatting inconsistencies, duplicate records, and data that's decayed since it was entered.</p>

        <p>Import dirty data and you've created a mess inside your CRM. Email dirty data and you hurt your sender reputation. Either way, you're paying for the shortcuts later.</p>

        <p>Cleaning before you use the list takes a day or two. Fixing the problems afterward takes weeks or months.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Email deliverability went from 72% to 94%."</blockquote>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Clean</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Email validation.</strong> Syntax checking, domain verification, mailbox validation. Remove bounces before they happen.</li>

          <li><strong>Duplicate detection.</strong> Find duplicates by email, by name + company, by phone. Remove, merge, or flag for review.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone formatting.</strong> Standardize to consistent format. Fix missing country codes, area codes, and formatting inconsistencies.</li>

          <li><strong>Name parsing.</strong> "John Smith" in one field becomes "John" and "Smith" in proper first/last fields. Handle prefixes and suffixes.</li>

          <li><strong>Company name standardization.</strong> "Acme Corp" and "Acme Corporation" become consistent. Ready for deduplication.</li>

          <li><strong>Address normalization.</strong> Street, city, state, ZIP in consistent formats. USPS validation available.</li>

          <li><strong>Field mapping.</strong> Your messy columns mapped to standard CRM fields. Ready for import.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> CSV, Excel, whatever format. Tell us what you're planning to do with it.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and clean.</strong> Identifying issues and applying appropriate cleaning for your use case.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA.</strong> Edge cases and ambiguous records get manual review. We don't guess.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Clean list delivered.</strong> Ready for import or campaign. Problem records flagged separately.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Contact list cleaning runs $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on volume and what cleaning you need. Email validation only is lower. Full cleaning with formatting, deduplication, and validation is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll quote based on your list size and requirements.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What does list cleaning include?</h3>
          <p>Email validation, duplicate removal, phone formatting, name parsing, address standardization, and field normalization.</p>

          <h3>What's a typical bad email rate?</h3>
          <p>20-40% in purchased lists. Sometimes worse. Cleaning before you mail protects your sender reputation.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle duplicates?</h3>
          <p>We identify duplicates by email, name + company, or phone. You choose: remove, merge (keeping best data), or flag for review.</p>

          <h3>Should I clean before or after CRM import?</h3>
          <p>Before. Always before. Cleaning inside your CRM is much harder than cleaning before import.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Clean Your List?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>
