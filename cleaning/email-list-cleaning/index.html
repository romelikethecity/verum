        <h2>Why Lists Get Dirty</h2>

        <p>Email addresses decay faster than you'd expect. People change jobs, and their work emails stop working. Companies get acquired and email domains change. Some addresses were entered incorrectly in the first place. Others were fake from the start.</p>

        <p>Research shows about 30% of business email addresses become invalid within a year. So a list you built two years ago might have 50% dead addresses. And that's an organic list. Purchased lists are often worse.</p>

        <p>Sending to dirty lists hurts you in two ways. The obvious cost is wasted effort. Emails that bounce reach nobody. But the hidden cost is worse: sender reputation damage. Email providers track your bounce rate. Hit too many bad addresses and they start blocking you. Land in a spam trap and you might get blacklisted entirely.</p>

        <p>Cleaning before sending removes the risk. Valid addresses go through. Invalid ones get removed. Your campaign performs better and your reputation stays intact.</p>

        <h2>What We Clean</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Syntax validation.</strong> Properly formed email addresses. Catches typos like missing @ symbols or double dots.</li>

          <li><strong>Domain verification.</strong> Does the domain exist? Does it have mail servers configured? Catches addresses at defunct domains.</li>

          <li><strong>Mailbox existence.</strong> Does this specific mailbox exist on this mail server? The core validation that catches invalid addresses.</li>

          <li><strong>Spam trap detection.</strong> Known spam trap addresses and patterns. Hitting these can get you blacklisted.</li>

          <li><strong>Duplicate removal.</strong> Same email appearing multiple times. Remove duplicates before sending duplicate messages.</li>

          <li><strong>Role address detection.</strong> Generic addresses like info@, sales@, support@. These often have lower engagement and higher complaint rates.</li>

          <li><strong>Catch-all detection.</strong> Domains that accept all mail regardless of mailbox existence. These hide invalid addresses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Get Back</h2>

        <p><strong>Validated list.</strong> Addresses that passed all checks. Safe to email.</p>

        <p><strong>Invalid addresses.</strong> Addresses that will definitely bounce. Remove from your list.</p>

        <p><strong>Risky addresses.</strong> Addresses that might work but have warning signs: catch-all domains, temporary domains, role addresses. Your call on whether to include them.</p>

        <p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Valid rate, invalid rate, risk breakdown. Know your list quality.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> CSV, Excel, or export from your email platform. Just the email column is fine, or full records if you have them.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We validate every address.</strong> Full verification sequence on each email.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Categorization.</strong> Valid, invalid, risky. Each address sorted with specific reasons.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Clean list delivered.</strong> Ready to import back to your email platform. Invalid addresses separated.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Email list cleaning runs $0.01-0.03 per email address, depending on volume. Larger lists get better rates.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Most lists are cleaned within 24 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What does cleaning include?</h3>
          <p>Syntax validation, domain verification, mailbox existence, spam trap detection, duplicate removal, and role address identification.</p>

          <h3>What's a typical invalid rate?</h3>
          <p>Purchased lists: 20-40%. Organic lists over 2 years: 20-30%. Event registrations: 5-15%. Lists that haven't been cleaned can be worse.</p>

          <h3>How does cleaning protect reputation?</h3>
          <p>Email providers track bounces. Too many and they block you. Spam traps can get you blacklisted. Cleaning removes these risks before they happen.</p>

          <h3>How often should I clean?</h3>
          <p>Before major campaigns if you're constantly adding addresses. Quarterly for stable lists. Always before using purchased or rented lists.</p>
        </div>
