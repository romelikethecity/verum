<h2>Lead Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>Lead data cleaning verifies and corrects the contact, company, and firmographic data attached to your inbound and outbound leads. It ensures that every lead your sales team works has accurate contact information, correct company details, and complete fields for scoring and routing.</p>

<p>Leads enter your system through web forms, list purchases, event scans, and integrations. Each source has different data quality. Form fills are incomplete. Purchased lists are outdated. Event scans are messy. Your sales team ends up researching every lead manually because they cannot trust what is in the CRM.</p>

<h2>What We Clean on Leads</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contact verification.</strong> Email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses are validated against live sources to confirm they are deliverable and current.</li>
    <li><strong>Company matching.</strong> Company names entered on forms are matched to authoritative company records. 'Ggl' becomes 'Google LLC' with full firmographic data attached.</li>
    <li><strong>Title standardization.</strong> Free-text job titles are mapped to standard seniority levels and functions so your scoring model can evaluate them consistently.</li>
    <li><strong>Source deduplication.</strong> Leads that entered from multiple sources get deduplicated so each person is only worked once.</li>
    <li><strong>Field completion.</strong> Missing fields like industry, company size, and revenue range get filled from external data sources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clean Lead Data Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lead scoring that accurately reflects fit because the underlying data fields are complete and correct</li>
    <li>Routing that sends leads to the right rep based on clean firmographic data, not guesswork</li>
    <li>Higher connect rates on outbound because email and phone data are verified before reps start calling</li>
    <li>Less SDR time wasted on research because leads arrive with complete, accurate information</li>
    <li>Better conversion tracking because duplicate leads are merged and attribution is clean</li>
</ul>
