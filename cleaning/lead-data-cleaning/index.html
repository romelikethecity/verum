        <h2>The Inbound Lead Problem</h2>

        <p>Form submissions lie. People enter fake emails to download your content. They type their personal phone instead of work. They abbreviate company names or misspell them entirely. Some fields get left blank because your form didn't require them.</p>

        <p>The result lands in your CRM looking like data, but it's not usable data. SDRs waste time researching contacts that could have been enriched automatically. They call numbers that don't work. They send emails that bounce. Speed-to-lead suffers while your team manually validates what should have been clean from the start.</p>

        <p>Then there's the junk. Competitors downloading your content to spy on you. Job seekers hoping you'll see their resume. Students doing research projects. Test submissions from your own team. They all look like leads until someone wastes time working them.</p>

        <p>The cost compounds. Your lead-to-opportunity rate looks worse than it should because the denominator includes garbage. Marketing gets blamed for lead quality when the real problem is data quality. Sales loses trust in inbound entirely and starts ignoring the good leads too.</p>

        <h2>What Lead Cleaning Includes</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Email validation.</strong> Real business emails vs personal vs fake. Deliverability verified at the SMTP level.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone verification.</strong> Valid numbers, proper formatting, landline vs mobile identification. Know what will actually connect.</li>

          <li><strong>Company standardization.</strong> "IBM" and "International Business Machines" and "IBM Corp" become one company. Match to real company records.</li>

          <li><strong>Duplicate detection.</strong> Same person submitting multiple forms. Same contact already in your database. Catch it before creating fragmention.</li>

          <li><strong>Field enrichment.</strong> Missing company size? Missing industry? We fill the gaps from external sources so routing and scoring work properly.</li>

          <li><strong>Junk filtering.</strong> Competitors, job seekers, students, test submissions. Flag or remove based on your rules.</li>

          <li><strong>Name parsing.</strong> First name, last name, properly split and capitalized. No more "john smith" or "JOHN SMITH" or "Smith, John".</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cleaning Flow Options</h2>

        <p>You can clean leads at different points depending on your workflow:</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-CRM cleaning.</strong> Leads get cleaned before hitting Salesforce or HubSpot. Sales never sees the junk. Best for high-volume forms where you want automatic quality control.</p>

        <p><strong>Post-CRM batch cleaning.</strong> Export your existing leads, we clean them, you import the results. Good for catching up on historical data quality debt.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing cleaning.</strong> New leads processed automatically as they come in. Set it up once, clean leads flow continuously. We can integrate with most marketing automation platforms.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Clean lead records.</strong> Validated emails, formatted phones, standardized companies. Ready for sales to work.</p>

        <p><strong>Quality flags.</strong> Which leads have verified data, which have issues, which are suspected junk. Let your routing rules use these signals.</p>

        <p><strong>Enriched fields.</strong> Company size, industry, job seniority. The data your scoring models need but forms didn't capture.</p>

        <p><strong>Duplicate indicators.</strong> This lead already exists. This lead submitted twice. Prevent fragmentation before it happens.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your leads.</strong> Export from your CRM or marketing platform. Or give us API access for ongoing cleaning.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We validate and enrich.</strong> Every lead runs through email validation, phone verification, company matching, and enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Quality categorization.</strong> Clean leads, problematic leads, junk leads. Each flagged with specific issues found.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Clean data delivered.</strong> Import back to your CRM or let our integration push it directly.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Lead data cleaning runs $0.02-0.05 per lead, depending on volume and enrichment depth. Higher volumes get better rates.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Most batches complete within 24 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How many leads typically have issues?</h3>
          <p>20-40% is normal. Fake emails, wrong phones, missing data, duplicates. Higher-traffic forms tend to be worse.</p>

          <h3>What does cleaning include?</h3>
          <p>Email validation, phone verification, company standardization, duplicate detection, enrichment, and junk filtering. The goal is workable leads for sales.</p>

          <h3>How fast?</h3>
          <p>Batch processing: 24-48 hours. Ongoing cleaning via integration: minutes after submission.</p>

          <h3>Before or after CRM?</h3>
          <p>Ideally before, so sales never sees junk. But cleaning existing CRM data works too. Many companies do both.</p>
