        <h2>Why People Look for Apollo Alternatives</h2>

        <p>Apollo.io delivers impressive value: 250M+ contacts, built-in outreach, affordable pricing starting at $49/month. But teams often outgrow it or hit limitations:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Data accuracy.</strong> Apollo's database is broad but not always deep. Bounce rates of 20&#8209;30% are common, especially for smaller companies and non-tech industries.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone number gaps.</strong> Apollo includes phone data, but coverage is inconsistent. Teams doing phone outreach often find they need supplemental sources.</li>

          <li><strong>No data cleaning.</strong> Apollo adds contacts to your CRM but doesn't help with duplicates, outdated records, or data hygiene. Adding more data to a messy CRM makes things worse.</li>

          <li><strong>European data limitations.</strong> Apollo's US coverage is stronger than EMEA. Teams selling internationally often need additional sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6 Apollo.io Alternatives to Consider</h2>

        <h3>1. Verum (Done-for-You Data Services)</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams whose real problem is data quality, not data quantity.</p>

        <p>Verum isn't a prospecting platform like Apollo. We're a done-for-you data service: you send us your database, we clean and enrich it, you get accurate results back. Different problem, different solution.</p>

        <p><strong>Key differences from Apollo:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project-based pricing ($500&#8209;5,000+) vs. per-seat subscriptions</li>
          <li>We do the work—no platform to learn or manage</li>
          <li>Focuses on fixing existing data, not adding more</li>
          <li>Human verification on every project</li>
          <li>Deduplication and validation included</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Consider Verum if:</strong> You've been using Apollo (or other sources) and your CRM is now full of duplicates, bounced emails, and inconsistent data. Before adding more contacts, clean what you have.</p>

        <h3>2. ZoomInfo</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Enterprise teams willing to pay for the largest database and most features.</p>

        <p>ZoomInfo is the market leader with the biggest B2B database, sophisticated intent signals, and comprehensive engagement tools. It costs significantly more than Apollo ($15K&#8209;50K+ annually) but delivers more for teams that can afford it.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Largest database, best intent data, comprehensive features</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive, annual contracts, complex platform, still doesn't clean your data</p>

        <h3>3. Cognism</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams selling into Europe or prioritizing phone outreach.</p>

        <p>Cognism built their reputation on GDPR-compliant European data and human-verified mobile numbers. If you're selling into EMEA or cold calling is central to your motion, Cognism often outperforms Apollo.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Best European data, Diamond Data verified phones, GDPR compliant</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive ($15K+ annually), weaker US coverage, no data cleaning</p>

        <h3>4. Lusha</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Individual SDRs who need quick, simple lookups.</p>

        <p>Lusha's browser extension makes contact lookup easy: see someone on LinkedIn, click to reveal their email and phone. Simpler than Apollo's full platform, though the per-credit model gets expensive at scale.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Dead simple to use, free tier, includes direct dials</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Per-lookup pricing scales poorly, not for batch work, no outreach features</p>

        <h3>5. Clearbit (now HubSpot)</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Product-led companies needing real-time enrichment.</p>

        <p>Clearbit pioneered API-first enrichment—instantly appending data when someone fills out a form. Now part of HubSpot, it's particularly valuable for PLG companies. Different use case than Apollo's prospecting focus.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Real-time enrichment, strong APIs, HubSpot integration</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires technical implementation, not for prospecting, becoming HubSpot-centric</p>

        <h3>6. Seamless.AI</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams wanting real-time contact verification.</p>

        <p>Seamless.AI verifies contacts in real-time as you search, claiming higher accuracy than static databases like Apollo. Credit-based pricing with plans starting around $147/month.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Real-time verification, Chrome extension, CRM integrations</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Mixed accuracy reviews, aggressive sales tactics reported, credit model can get expensive</p>

        <h2>The Real Problem Might Not Be Apollo</h2>

        <p>Before switching data providers, consider: do you have a data source problem or a data quality problem?</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Data source problem:</strong> "Apollo doesn't have accurate contacts for my target market." → Try ZoomInfo, Cognism, or Lusha.</li>

          <li><strong>Data quality problem:</strong> "My CRM is full of duplicates and outdated contacts from Apollo and other sources." → You need data cleaning. That's what Verum does.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many teams discover that their Apollo data isn't the problem—the problem is years of accumulated data from multiple sources, never properly cleaned or deduplicated. Switching to another provider adds more data to the mess.</p>

        <p>A clean database with 5,000 accurate contacts outperforms a messy database with 50,000 records where half are duplicates, outdated, or wrong.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What is the best Apollo.io alternative?</h3>
          <p>The best Apollo alternative depends on your needs. ZoomInfo offers the largest database and most features but costs significantly more. Cognism is better for European data. Lusha is simpler for individual lookups. Verum is best if you need data cleaning rather than more prospecting—we fix your existing data instead of adding to it.</p>

          <h3>Why do people switch from Apollo.io?</h3>
          <p>Common reasons include: data quality concerns (high bounce rates, outdated contacts), limited phone number coverage, wanting more sophisticated intent data, needing better European coverage, or realizing that adding more data to a messy CRM doesn't solve the underlying data quality problem.</p>

          <h3>Is Apollo better than ZoomInfo?</h3>
          <p>Apollo offers better value for budget-conscious teams with its free tier and affordable paid plans. ZoomInfo has a larger, more accurate database and more sophisticated features. For small teams or startups, Apollo is often the better choice. For enterprise sales teams with budget, ZoomInfo delivers more.</p>

          <h3>Can I keep using Apollo and add Verum?</h3>
          <p>Yes, many teams do. Use Apollo for prospecting and adding new contacts, then use Verum quarterly to clean your entire CRM—deduplicating Apollo imports, validating existing contacts, and enriching incomplete records. The combination costs less than enterprise platforms while solving both problems.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>A Different Approach to Data</h2>

        <p>If you're looking at Apollo alternatives because your data is inaccurate or messy, maybe you don't need another prospecting platform. Maybe you need someone to clean what you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Sample project:</strong> Send us a sample of your data. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what Verum delivers. No cost, no commitment.</p>
