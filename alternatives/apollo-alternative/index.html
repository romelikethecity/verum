<p><strong>Apollo alternative</strong>: Verum provides verified, done-for-you data enrichment and cleaning without the self-serve learning curve. Instead of burning through credits and QA-ing Apollo's output yourself, you get human-verified data delivered ready to use. Per-record pricing, no credit system, results in 24-48 hours.</p>

<h2>Why Teams Look for Apollo Alternatives</h2>

<p>Apollo.io has built an impressive all-in-one platform. Prospecting database, email sequences, dialer, analytics. For the price, you get a lot. But that breadth comes with tradeoffs, and not every team's experience with Apollo matches the marketing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data accuracy is a real concern.</strong> Apollo's database is massive, but many users report that contact data accuracy varies significantly by industry and company size. Emails bounce. Phone numbers are stale. Job titles are outdated. When your SDRs are working off bad data, they waste hours chasing contacts who left the company six months ago. Some teams report 30-40% bounce rates on Apollo-sourced emails in certain verticals.</li>
  <li><strong>The feature set is overwhelming when you just need data.</strong> Apollo bundles prospecting, outreach sequences, a dialer, meeting scheduling, deal tracking, and analytics. If all you need is clean, accurate contact data for your existing workflow, you're navigating a complex platform to get to one feature. That's a lot of UI for a simple need.</li>
  <li><strong>The credit system burns through fast.</strong> Apollo's pricing is credit-based. Every email reveal, phone unlock, and export costs credits. Teams that run aggressive outreach campaigns can burn through their monthly allocation in the first two weeks. Then it's either wait for the reset or upgrade to a higher tier. The "unlimited" plan has its own fine print around fair use policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Quality varies by market segment.</strong> Apollo's data tends to be strongest for tech companies and well-funded startups. If you sell into healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, or local businesses, the coverage thins out. Owner data for SMBs? Sparse. Niche professional services? Hit or miss. The database was built tech-first, and it shows in other verticals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Verum Is Different</h2>

<h3>Verified data, not volume</h3>
<p>Apollo gives you access to 270M+ contacts. The question is how many of those are accurate for your specific use case. Verum takes the opposite approach: we deliver fewer records, but every one of them has been verified. Human QA on every project. A 93% deliverability guarantee on the contact information we provide. We'd rather give you 5,000 records you can actually use than 50,000 where a third bounce.</p>

<h3>Done-for-you, no learning curve</h3>
<p>Apollo is powerful software. That means it takes time to learn, configure, and operate effectively. You need someone on your team who knows how to build search filters, set up sequences, manage credit allocation, and QA the output. Verum skips all of that. Tell us your target market, send us your existing data, and we do the rest. No platform to learn, no workflows to build, no credits to manage.</p>

<h3>Data cleaning built in</h3>
<p>Apollo is a prospecting tool. It helps you find new contacts. But what about the 30,000 contacts already sitting in your CRM? If those records are full of duplicates, outdated emails, and missing fields, layering Apollo data on top just makes the mess bigger. Verum starts by cleaning what you have, then enriches and fills gaps. Most teams discover they already have 60-70% of the data they need. It just needs to be fixed.</p>

<h3>Per-record pricing, no credits</h3>
<p>You pay for the records we process. Not for a credit balance that depletes as you use it, not for a seat license, not for an annual subscription. A project with 5,000 records costs what 5,000 records costs. You won't get a surprise mid-month when your credits run out, and you won't be sitting on unused credits at the end of the billing cycle.</p>

<h3>Strong outside of tech</h3>
<p>Apollo's database was built from tech companies outward. Verum works across verticals. Healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, professional services, local businesses. We use 50+ data sources and industry-specific verification methods. If you're selling into a market where Apollo's coverage is thin, that gap is where Verum delivers the most value.</p>

<h2>Who Should Consider Verum</h2>

<p>Apollo is great for teams that want an all-in-one outbound platform and have the bandwidth to operate it. If that's you, it's hard to beat for the price. But if your situation looks more like one of these, we're probably a better fit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Teams that need data, not a platform.</strong> You already have your outreach tools (Outreach, Salesloft, HubSpot sequences, whatever). You just need the data to be right. Verum gives you clean data to load into your existing workflow, not a new platform to adopt.</li>
  <li><strong>Companies selling outside of tech.</strong> Healthcare, financial services, construction, local services. If Apollo's coverage in your market is spotty, you need a provider that can actually find and verify contacts in your vertical.</li>
  <li><strong>Small teams without data ops staff.</strong> If nobody on your team has time to build Apollo searches, manage credit allocation, and QA exports, that platform will sit unused. A done-for-you service fits better when everyone's already wearing three hats.</li>
  <li><strong>Anyone tired of QA-ing their data provider's output.</strong> If you're exporting from Apollo and then spending hours cleaning the results before loading them into your CRM, you're doing double the work. Verum delivers data that's ready to use.</li>
  <li><strong>Teams with existing CRM data that needs fixing.</strong> If your real problem is that your current database is a mess, no amount of net-new prospecting data solves that. Clean what you have first, then grow from a solid foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Questions</h2>

<h3>Is Verum cheaper than Apollo?</h3>
<p>It depends on how you use Apollo. Apollo's free tier is genuinely generous for small teams. If that's all you need, it's hard to beat free. But once you're on a paid plan ($49-$119/user/month), the cost adds up, especially if you have multiple seats. Verum's per-record pricing means you pay for output, not access. For teams doing periodic data projects rather than daily prospecting, Verum often costs less. For teams running high-volume daily outreach, Apollo's subscription model might make more sense.</p>

<h3>Can I use Verum and Apollo together?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. Some teams use Apollo for day-to-day prospecting and Verum for quarterly database cleaning, bulk enrichment projects, or specific market research. They're not mutually exclusive. If Apollo is working well for your outbound motion but your CRM database is a mess, Verum solves the second problem without replacing the first.</p>

<h3>Apollo has a huge database. How does Verum's coverage compare?</h3>
<p>Apollo advertises 270M+ contacts. Verum doesn't maintain a static database. We pull from 50+ live data sources for each project, which means we're checking current information rather than serving records from a database that may be months old. The result is fewer total records but higher accuracy on what we deliver. If you need to browse millions of contacts and self-serve, Apollo is better suited. If you need a specific set of contacts that are verified and accurate, that's what we do.</p>
