        <h2>Why People Look for Lusha Alternatives</h2>

        <p>Lusha excels at what it does: quick contact lookups via browser extension. See someone on LinkedIn, click, get their email and phone. For individual SDRs doing manual prospecting, it's convenient.</p>

        <p>But teams often hit limitations:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Credit costs at scale.</strong> At roughly $0.90 per contact on Pro plans, looking up 500 contacts costs $450. That adds up fast for teams doing high-volume prospecting.</li>

          <li><strong>One-at-a-time workflow.</strong> Lusha is designed for individual lookups. If you need to enrich 5,000 existing CRM records, clicking through one at a time isn't practical.</li>

          <li><strong>No data cleaning.</strong> Lusha adds contact info but doesn't help with duplicates, outdated records, or data validation. Your CRM problems persist.</li>

          <li><strong>Limited to lookups.</strong> Lusha doesn't include outreach tools. If you want prospecting and email sequences in one place, you need additional tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6 Lusha Alternatives to Consider</h2>

        <h3>1. Verum (Done-for-You Data Services)</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams that need to process data in bulk, not look up contacts one at a time.</p>

        <p>Verum works at the database level rather than the contact level. Instead of clicking through LinkedIn profiles, you export your CRM, we clean and enrich everything, and you get accurate data back. Different approach for different problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Key differences from Lusha:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Batch processing, not one-at-a-time lookups</li>
          <li>Project-based pricing ($500&#8209;5,000+) vs. per-credit</li>
          <li>Includes deduplication and data cleaning</li>
          <li>Human verification on every project</li>
          <li>We do the work—no browser extension needed</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Consider Verum if:</strong> You have thousands of existing records that need enrichment, or your CRM is cluttered with duplicates and outdated data that Lusha can't fix.</p>

        <p><strong>Not right if:</strong> You need instant lookups while browsing LinkedIn. That's Lusha's strength.</p>

        <h3>2. Apollo.io</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams wanting a full prospecting platform with unlimited access.</p>

        <p>Apollo offers a browser extension similar to Lusha, but also includes a full prospecting database, email sequencing, and dialer. Most importantly, their paid plans offer unlimited email reveals—no credit counting.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Unlimited access on paid plans, includes outreach tools, larger database</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> More complex than Lusha, data quality varies, still doesn't clean existing data</p>

        <h3>3. Cognism</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams prioritizing phone numbers and European data.</p>

        <p>Cognism's Diamond Data program human-verifies phone numbers—something Lusha's automated system can't match. For cold calling teams, especially those targeting EMEA, Cognism often delivers better phone data.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Best phone number accuracy, strong European data, GDPR compliant</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive ($15K+ annually), overkill for email-only outreach</p>

        <h3>4. Seamless.AI</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams wanting Lusha-style lookups with real-time verification.</p>

        <p>Seamless.AI offers a similar browser extension experience to Lusha but verifies contacts in real-time as you search, claiming higher accuracy. Credit-based pricing starting around $147/month.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Real-time verification, Chrome extension, similar UX to Lusha</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Mixed accuracy reviews, aggressive sales tactics, credit model still applies</p>

        <h3>5. ZoomInfo</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Enterprise teams needing the largest database with comprehensive features.</p>

        <p>ZoomInfo is the market leader with the biggest B2B database. Overkill for teams just doing LinkedIn lookups, but for enterprise sales teams, it's the most comprehensive option.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Largest database, intent data, comprehensive features</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Very expensive ($15K&#8209;50K+ annually), complex platform, annual contracts</p>

        <h3>6. LinkedIn Sales Navigator</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams doing relationship-based selling on LinkedIn.</p>

        <p>Sales Navigator doesn't reveal contact info like Lusha, but for teams focused on LinkedIn engagement, the advanced search, InMail, and relationship intelligence features are valuable at $79&#8209;139/month.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Direct LinkedIn access, no credit limits, relationship tracking</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> No email or phone reveals, limited to LinkedIn users</p>

        </table>

        <h2>The Scale Problem with Per-Credit Pricing</h2>

        <p>Lusha's pricing model works for low-volume lookups:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Free: 5 credits/month</li>
          <li>Pro: $36/user/month (40 credits)</li>
          <li>Premium: $59/user/month (80 credits)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At 40 credits for $36, you're paying about $0.90 per contact. That's reasonable for 50&#8209;100 lookups per month.</p>

        <p>But what if you need to enrich 5,000 existing CRM records? At Lusha rates, that's $4,500—plus hours of manual work clicking through each one.</p>

        <p>This is where project-based alternatives like Verum make sense. A 5,000-record enrichment project might cost $2,000&#8209;3,000 with Verum, processed in 24&#8209;48 hours with no manual work on your end.</p>

        <h2>Lookups vs. Database Cleaning</h2>

        <p>Before choosing a Lusha alternative, clarify your actual need:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Individual lookups:</strong> "I need to find contact info while browsing LinkedIn." → Apollo, Seamless.AI, or stick with Lusha.</li>

          <li><strong>Database enrichment:</strong> "I have 10,000 CRM records that need emails and phones added." → Verum or ZoomInfo enrichment.</li>

          <li><strong>Database cleaning:</strong> "My CRM has duplicates, outdated contacts, and messy data." → Verum. Lusha alternatives don't solve this problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many teams discover that their real problem isn't finding new contacts—it's that their existing database is a mess. Lusha can't help with that. Neither can most Lusha alternatives.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What is the best Lusha alternative?</h3>
          <p>The best Lusha alternative depends on your volume and use case. Apollo.io is best for teams wanting prospecting plus outreach at scale. Cognism is better for European data and verified phone numbers. Seamless.AI offers similar browser extension functionality. Verum is best for teams that need to clean and enrich existing data rather than doing individual lookups.</p>

          <h3>Why do people switch from Lusha?</h3>
          <p>Common reasons include: credit model getting expensive at scale, needing more than just contact lookups (like data cleaning or outreach tools), wanting better phone number coverage, or realizing that one-at-a-time lookups aren't efficient for large prospecting lists.</p>

          <h3>Is there a free Lusha alternative?</h3>
          <p>Apollo.io offers a free tier with 600 email credits per year—more than Lusha's 5 credits per month. LinkedIn Sales Navigator isn't free but doesn't use credits. For data cleaning, Verum offers free sample projects to demonstrate quality before any commitment.</p>

          <h3>Can I use Lusha and Verum together?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Use Lusha for quick lookups when you find interesting prospects on LinkedIn. Use Verum quarterly to clean your entire CRM—deduplicating Lusha imports, validating existing contacts, and enriching incomplete records. Lusha adds data one at a time; Verum keeps your whole database clean.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Try a Different Approach</h2>

        <p>If you're looking at Lusha alternatives because credit costs are adding up or you have thousands of records to process, maybe per-contact pricing isn't the right model. Verum's project-based approach handles bulk work efficiently.</p>

        <p><strong>Free assessment:</strong> Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest recommendation—even if that means Lusha or another lookup tool is the right choice.</p>

        <p><strong>Sample project:</strong> Send us a sample of your data. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see exactly what Verum delivers. No cost, no commitment.</p>
