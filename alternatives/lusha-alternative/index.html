<p><strong>Lusha alternative</strong>: Verum handles the bulk data operations that Lusha wasn't built for. Data cleaning, enrichment, owner identification, and database-wide QA, all done for you. No per-seat fees, no credit limits, no Chrome extension required.</p>

<h2>Why Teams Look for Lusha Alternatives</h2>

<p>Lusha is a solid tool for what it does: quick contact lookups from LinkedIn profiles. The Chrome extension is fast, the data is decent for common roles at well-known companies, and the UI is simple. But as teams grow or their data needs get more complex, Lusha's limitations become clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Per-seat pricing gets expensive at scale.</strong> Lusha charges per user per month, with credit allocations that vary by plan. For a single SDR doing one-off lookups, the cost is reasonable. But once you have 10, 20, or 50 people on the platform, you're paying seat fees whether those users are active or not. A 15-person sales team on Lusha's Pro plan can easily run $500-$700/month, and that's before anyone runs out of credits.</li>
  <li><strong>Credits run out fast.</strong> Lusha's credit system means every contact reveal costs a credit. Run an aggressive prospecting campaign and your team hits the wall mid-month. Then it's either upgrade the plan, buy credit add-ons, or tell your reps to slow down. None of those are great options when you're trying to hit pipeline targets.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited to contact lookups.</strong> Lusha gives you an email and a phone number for a person you've already found. That's useful, but it's a narrow slice of what most teams actually need. Lusha doesn't clean your existing data, doesn't identify business owners, doesn't deduplicate your CRM, doesn't verify your database at scale. It's a lookup tool, not a data solution.</li>
  <li><strong>The Chrome extension model doesn't scale.</strong> Lusha's workflow is: find someone on LinkedIn, click the extension, get their contact info. That works for individual lookups. But if you need to enrich 10,000 records in your CRM, clean up a messy database after a migration, or build a targeted list of business owners in a specific market, clicking a Chrome extension one record at a time isn't realistic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Verum Is Different</h2>

<h3>Built for bulk operations</h3>
<p>Verum processes thousands of records at once. You send us a file (or connect us to your CRM), we clean and enrich the entire dataset, and deliver it back ready to use. No clicking through profiles one at a time, no credit counters, no wondering if you have enough lookups left. Whether it's 500 records or 50,000, the process is the same.</p>

<h3>Data cleaning, not just lookups</h3>
<p>Lusha helps you find contact info for people you already know about. Verum starts earlier in the process: cleaning what you already have. We remove duplicates, standardize fields, verify emails, fill in missing data, and flag records that are too stale to use. This is the work that Lusha never touches but that most CRMs desperately need.</p>

<h3>Owner and decision-maker identification</h3>
<p>One of Verum's core capabilities is identifying business owners, founders, and decision-makers, especially at small and mid-market companies where this information isn't readily available on LinkedIn. We verify these contacts against multiple sources and deliver validated contact information. If you sell to SMBs, this is where most lookup tools fall short.</p>

<h3>No per-seat fees</h3>
<p>Verum charges per record processed, not per user. Your entire team benefits from the clean data we deliver without each person needing their own license. Add five new reps next quarter? The cost of your data doesn't change. This makes scaling predictable instead of expensive.</p>

<h3>Human QA on every project</h3>
<p>Lusha's data comes from an automated database. Our process includes human verification. We check the data we deliver for accuracy, flag anomalies, and guarantee 93% deliverability on the contact information we provide. When you're paying for data, the last thing you want is to spend additional time verifying it yourself.</p>

<h2>Who Should Consider Verum</h2>

<p>Lusha works well for individual SDRs doing targeted LinkedIn outreach. If your whole workflow is "find a person on LinkedIn, get their email, send a message," Lusha handles that fine. But if your needs go beyond that, here's where Verum fits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Teams that need bulk data operations.</strong> If you have 10,000+ records in your CRM that need cleaning, enrichment, or verification, you need a bulk solution. Clicking a Chrome extension isn't going to get you there.</li>
  <li><strong>Growing teams watching seat costs climb.</strong> If every new hire means another $30-$80/month in data tool fees, per-record pricing gives you more predictable costs. Your data budget shouldn't scale linearly with headcount.</li>
  <li><strong>Companies selling to SMBs and local businesses.</strong> Owner data for small businesses is Lusha's blind spot and Verum's strength. If you need to find the actual decision-maker at a 15-person company that doesn't have a LinkedIn presence, we're built for that.</li>
  <li><strong>Teams doing CRM migrations or cleanups.</strong> Moving from one CRM to another? Merging databases after an acquisition? These are bulk data projects that require cleaning, deduplication, and enrichment. Lusha wasn't built for this. Verum was.</li>
  <li><strong>Anyone who needs data cleaning, not just more data.</strong> If your real problem is that your existing database is full of duplicates, outdated emails, and incomplete records, adding more contact lookups on top doesn't solve the underlying issue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Questions</h2>

<h3>Is Verum more expensive than Lusha?</h3>
<p>On a per-lookup basis, Lusha can be cheaper for individual contact reveals, especially on their free or lower tiers. But the comparison shifts when you factor in the full picture. Lusha charges per seat plus credits, so a 10-person team paying $50/user/month plus credit overages can easily spend $600+/month. Verum charges per record with no seat fees, so a one-time project to clean and enrich 5,000 records might cost a similar amount but covers your entire database in one shot. The better question is: what are you actually trying to accomplish?</p>

<h3>Can I use Verum for one-off lookups like Lusha?</h3>
<p>Verum isn't designed for real-time, one-at-a-time lookups. If you need to quickly grab a phone number before a cold call, Lusha or a similar Chrome extension is faster for that use case. Verum is built for batch work: cleaning databases, enriching contact lists, identifying business owners across hundreds or thousands of records. Some teams use both: Lusha for in-the-moment lookups and Verum for periodic database maintenance and bulk projects.</p>

<h3>What if I only need to enrich a few hundred records?</h3>
<p>That's fine. There's no minimum order size. If you have 300 records that need cleaning and enrichment, we'll process 300 records. You won't be pushed into a larger commitment or a plan tier you don't need. Per-record pricing means the scope is whatever you need it to be.</p>
