<p><strong>Cognism alternative</strong>: Verum provides done-for-you data cleaning and enrichment focused on the US market. Instead of paying $15K+/year for a self-serve platform built around European mobile numbers, you send us your data and we send it back clean, complete, and verified. Per-record pricing, no annual contracts, results in 24-48 hours.</p>

<h2>Why Teams Look for Cognism Alternatives</h2>

<p>Cognism has built a strong reputation, especially in EMEA. Their phone-verified mobile data for European contacts is genuinely best-in-class. But not every team selling B2B needs a platform optimized for calling prospects in London and Frankfurt. Here's what we hear from teams considering a switch:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>EMEA-first coverage doesn't match a US-focused GTM.</strong> Cognism's biggest differentiator is Diamond Data: human-verified European mobile numbers. If your sales team is calling into North America, that's a premium you're paying for a feature that doesn't help you. US coverage exists in Cognism's database, but it's not where the product shines.</li>
  <li><strong>Annual contracts lock you in.</strong> Cognism requires annual commitments, typically starting around $15,000-$25,000/year. For growing teams or companies with seasonal sales cycles, that's a big commitment before you've validated whether the data actually converts for your market.</li>
  <li><strong>It's still a self-serve platform.</strong> Cognism gives you access to their database and tools, but someone on your team needs to build lists, manage filters, export data, and QA the results. If you don't have a dedicated data ops person, the platform ends up underused.</li>
  <li><strong>Data cleaning isn't part of the deal.</strong> Cognism helps you find new contacts. But if your existing CRM is full of duplicates, outdated titles, and bad emails, that's a separate problem you're left to solve on your own. Layering new contacts onto a messy database just makes the mess bigger.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cognism is a good product for the right buyer. If you're running outbound across Europe and need verified mobile numbers for EMEA decision-makers, it's hard to beat. But if you sell primarily in the US and want someone to handle data quality for you, there's a different approach.</p>

<h2>How Verum Is Different</h2>

<h3>US-focused, not EMEA-first</h3>
<p>Verum is built for companies selling into the US market. We source from 50+ US-focused data providers, cross-reference against public business registrations, NPI databases (for healthcare), state licensing boards, and verified corporate directories. We're not trying to cover every country. We go deep on the US because that's where our clients sell.</p>

<h3>Done-for-you, not self-serve</h3>
<p>Verum isn't a platform you log into. You tell us what you need, send us your data (or describe your target market), and we handle the rest. No training, no onboarding calls, no figuring out filters. We do the work. You get clean data back. This is the fundamental difference: we're a service, not software.</p>

<h3>Data cleaning included</h3>
<p>Cognism is a contact database. If your existing CRM data has problems (and it does), that's your problem to solve. Verum starts by cleaning what you already have. We deduplicate, standardize, verify, and fill in missing fields. Most teams find they already have 60-70% of what they need sitting in their CRM. It just needs to be fixed before you start adding new contacts on top of it.</p>

<h3>Per-record pricing</h3>
<p>You pay for the records we process. Not a platform seat, not an annual license. If you need 5,000 contacts cleaned and enriched, you pay for 5,000 contacts. Not a $15K minimum. Not a 12-month commitment. This works especially well for agencies, seasonal businesses, or teams that need a one-time data cleanup before a product launch or territory expansion.</p>

<h3>Human verification on every project</h3>
<p>Cognism's Diamond Data uses human callers to verify phone numbers. That's a smart approach for mobile verification. Verum applies human QA across the entire record, not just the phone number. We check names, titles, company associations, emails, and phone numbers against multiple sources. The result is a 93% deliverability guarantee on the contact information we deliver.</p>

<h2>Who Should Consider Verum</h2>

<p>If you're running outbound sales across EMEA and need verified European mobile numbers, Cognism is a strong choice. But if any of these describe your situation, we're worth a conversation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>US-focused sales teams</strong> that don't get enough value from an EMEA-optimized database. If 80%+ of your pipeline is domestic, your data provider should reflect that.</li>
  <li><strong>Companies without dedicated data ops.</strong> You don't have someone whose job it is to build lists and manage a prospecting platform. You need the data work done, not a tool to do it with.</li>
  <li><strong>Teams that need data cleaning, not just new contacts.</strong> Cognism helps you find people. Verum helps you fix the 50,000 records you already have and then find more if you need them.</li>
  <li><strong>Agencies managing client data.</strong> You need clean data for multiple clients on different timelines. Per-project pricing makes more sense than per-seat annual licenses.</li>
  <li><strong>Budget-conscious teams.</strong> You can't justify $15K-$25K/year for a platform when you only need data for specific projects or quarterly campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Questions</h2>

<h3>Is Cognism worth it if I only sell in the US?</h3>
<p>Cognism's biggest strength is EMEA mobile data. Their European phone-verified numbers are genuinely excellent. But if your market is primarily the US, you're paying a premium for a database that's optimized for a different geography. US coverage exists, but it's not where Cognism differentiates. Verum focuses exclusively on the US market with multi-source verification across 50+ data providers.</p>

<h3>How does Verum's pricing compare to Cognism?</h3>
<p>Cognism contracts typically start around $15,000-$25,000 per year with annual commitments. Verum charges per record processed, so a typical project runs a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on volume. No annual contract, no minimum commitment. You can run a single project and decide from there.</p>

<h3>Can Verum match Cognism's phone-verified mobile numbers?</h3>
<p>Cognism's Diamond Data (human-verified mobile numbers) is their flagship feature, and they do it well for EMEA contacts. Verum takes a different approach: we verify contact data across 50+ sources and include human QA on every project. We don't cold-call contacts to verify their number, but we do cross-reference multiple databases to confirm accuracy. For US contacts, our multi-source approach typically delivers comparable or better results than any single verification method.</p>
