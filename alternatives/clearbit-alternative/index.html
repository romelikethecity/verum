<p><strong>Clearbit alternative</strong>: With Clearbit now absorbed into HubSpot as Breeze Intelligence, many teams need a CRM-agnostic data partner. Verum provides data cleaning and enrichment that works with any CRM, any tech stack, and any workflow. No platform lock-in, no subscription required.</p>

<h2>Why Teams Look for Clearbit Alternatives</h2>

<p>Clearbit built a great product. Real-time enrichment, clean APIs, solid company data. Then HubSpot acquired them, rebranded it as Breeze Intelligence, and the landscape changed. Here's what we hear from former Clearbit users:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The HubSpot lock-in problem.</strong> Clearbit as a standalone product is gone. Breeze Intelligence is a HubSpot feature now. If you're on Salesforce, Pipedrive, or any other CRM, you've lost your enrichment provider. Even if you are on HubSpot, the integration is tighter but the flexibility is narrower. You're inside HubSpot's ecosystem whether you want to be or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Enrichment without cleaning.</strong> Clearbit was always an enrichment tool, not a data cleaning tool. It could append company data to a contact record, but it couldn't tell you that 15% of your database is duplicates, that 3,000 records have no valid email, or that your industry field has 47 different variations of "healthcare." If your data is messy before enrichment, it's still messy after. Just with more fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Shallow on owner and decision-maker data.</strong> Clearbit excelled at company-level firmographics: employee count, revenue range, tech stack, industry classification. But when you needed to find the actual person who makes buying decisions at a 40-person company, especially outside of tech? Coverage dropped off. Owner data for SMBs and mid-market was consistently thin.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing changes with the acquisition.</strong> Clearbit's pricing was already opaque (custom quotes for most plans). Under HubSpot, the enrichment credits are bundled into HubSpot tiers, which makes it harder to evaluate the cost of enrichment alone. Some teams that were paying $X for Clearbit standalone are now looking at a larger HubSpot bill for the same functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Verum Is Different</h2>

<h3>CRM-agnostic by design</h3>
<p>Verum works with whatever you use. Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, a spreadsheet, something proprietary. We don't care. You send us data in any format, we send it back clean and enriched. No API integration required, no CRM dependency, no vendor lock-in. If you switch CRMs next year, your relationship with us doesn't change.</p>

<h3>Cleaning and enrichment together</h3>
<p>This is the gap Clearbit never filled. Before we enrich your data, we clean it. Deduplication, standardization, email verification, field normalization. We fix what's broken, then we fill in what's missing. One process, one deliverable, no stitching together multiple tools.</p>

<h3>Deep owner and decision-maker data</h3>
<p>We don't just append firmographics. We identify business owners, founders, managing partners, and decision-makers. We verify them against multiple sources and deliver validated contact information. This matters most for teams selling into SMBs and mid-market companies where the org chart isn't on LinkedIn.</p>

<h3>Done-for-you service</h3>
<p>Clearbit was an API. Breeze Intelligence is a feature inside HubSpot. Both require your team to configure, manage, and QA the output. Verum is a service. You describe what you need, we do the work, you get results. No configuration, no learning curve, no maintenance.</p>

<h3>No subscription required</h3>
<p>You can use Verum once and never come back. Or use us monthly. Or quarterly when things get messy. There's no annual contract, no credit system, no minimum commitment. Per-record pricing means you pay for what you use and nothing more.</p>

<h2>Who Should Consider Verum</h2>

<p>If you loved Clearbit and you're happily on HubSpot, Breeze Intelligence might work fine for you. But if your situation looks more like one of these, Verum is worth a look:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Teams on Salesforce or other CRMs</strong> who lost their enrichment provider when Clearbit went HubSpot-only. You need something that works regardless of your tech stack.</li>
  <li><strong>Companies that need data cleaning, not just enrichment.</strong> If your CRM has years of accumulated data debt (duplicates, outdated records, inconsistent formatting), enrichment alone won't fix the underlying problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Sales teams targeting SMBs and mid-market.</strong> If you sell to businesses with 10-500 employees, you need owner-level data, not just firmographics. That's where Clearbit was weakest and where Verum is strongest.</li>
  <li><strong>Marketing ops teams tired of managing integrations.</strong> If you'd rather hand off data work entirely than configure another API connection, a done-for-you service saves time you can spend on campaigns.</li>
  <li><strong>Anyone who wants to avoid platform dependency.</strong> After watching Clearbit get absorbed, some teams are looking for data partners that aren't one acquisition away from disappearing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Questions</h2>

<h3>I'm on HubSpot. Should I just use Breeze Intelligence instead?</h3>
<p>If you only need basic company enrichment (employee count, industry, revenue) and you're already paying for a HubSpot tier that includes it, Breeze might cover your needs. But if you need data cleaning, owner identification, or deeper enrichment than HubSpot's built-in credits provide, Verum fills those gaps. Many HubSpot teams use both: Breeze for real-time form enrichment, Verum for bulk cleaning and deeper projects.</p>

<h3>Can Verum replicate Clearbit's real-time enrichment API?</h3>
<p>No, and we don't try to. If you need instant enrichment the moment a form is submitted, that's a real-time API use case and there are good tools for it. Verum is built for batch operations: cleaning your database, enriching thousands of records, building prospect lists, identifying business owners. Different problem, different solution.

There's no license that expires, no deletion clause, no "you must maintain your subscription to keep accessing the data." That was actually one of the cleaner things about old Clearbit too, and we kept the same philosophy.</p>
