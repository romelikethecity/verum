        <h2>Why People Look for Clearbit Alternatives</h2>

        <p>Clearbit built an excellent product for real-time data enrichment. But the HubSpot acquisition and the API-first model create situations where alternatives make sense:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>HubSpot acquisition concerns.</strong> Clearbit is becoming increasingly HubSpot-centric. If you're on Salesforce, Pipedrive, or another CRM, the integration story may weaken over time.</li>

          <li><strong>Technical overhead.</strong> Clearbit's power comes from APIs. That requires developers to implement and maintain integrations—overhead not every team can support.</li>

          <li><strong>Real-time vs. batch.</strong> Clearbit excels at enriching forms in real-time. But if you need to clean and enrich thousands of existing records, real-time APIs are the wrong tool.</li>

          <li><strong>Pricing at scale.</strong> Clearbit charges per API call or by monthly volume. For batch enrichment of large databases, this gets expensive quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6 Clearbit Alternatives to Consider</h2>

        <h3>1. Verum (Done-for-You Data Services)</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams that need batch enrichment without technical implementation.</p>

        <p>Verum takes the opposite approach from Clearbit: instead of APIs you implement yourself, we're a done-for-you service. Export your data, we clean and enrich it, you import the results. No technical resources required.</p>

        <p><strong>Key differences from Clearbit:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>No API integration or developers needed</li>
          <li>Project-based pricing ($500&#8209;5,000+) vs. per-API-call</li>
          <li>Includes data cleaning and deduplication</li>
          <li>Human verification on every project</li>
          <li>Works with any CRM or system</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Consider Verum if:</strong> You need to enrich existing database records in bulk, don't have technical resources for API integration, or want cleaning alongside enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Not right if:</strong> You need real-time form enrichment as people submit. That's Clearbit's strength; Verum does batch processing.</p>

        <h3>2. Apollo.io</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams wanting enrichment plus prospecting and outreach in one platform.</p>

        <p>Apollo offers data enrichment alongside their prospecting database and outreach tools. Their enrichment API can handle real-time use cases, though it's not as polished as Clearbit's was.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> All-in-one platform, affordable pricing, good for startups</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Enrichment isn't their focus, data quality varies, still requires technical implementation for API use</p>

        <h3>3. ZoomInfo</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Enterprise teams needing comprehensive data and enrichment capabilities.</p>

        <p>ZoomInfo has enrichment APIs that can replace Clearbit for real-time use cases. Their database is larger, though their APIs are less elegant. Significant price increase from Clearbit.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Largest database, comprehensive features, strong enrichment</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive ($15K&#8209;50K+ annually), complex platform, requires technical implementation</p>

        <h3>4. 6sense</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams that used Clearbit Reveal for website visitor identification.</p>

        <p>If Clearbit Reveal (identifying anonymous website visitors) was your main use case, 6sense is a direct competitor. They focus on intent data and account identification for ABM strategies.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong visitor identification, intent signals, ABM focus</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Enterprise pricing, complex platform, different product than Clearbit's enrichment APIs</p>

        <h3>5. People Data Labs</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Technical teams building custom data applications.</p>

        <p>People Data Labs offers raw data APIs similar to Clearbit's—person and company data you can query programmatically. Good for teams with engineering resources building data-powered products.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Flexible APIs, competitive pricing, developer-friendly</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires significant technical work, raw data needs processing, no turnkey solution</p>

        <h3>6. Cognism</h3>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams needing European data or verified phone numbers.</p>

        <p>Cognism isn't a direct Clearbit replacement, but if your enrichment needs include European contacts or phone numbers, their GDPR-compliant data and Diamond Data verified phones are strong.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Best European data, verified phone numbers, GDPR compliant</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not API-first like Clearbit, expensive, more prospecting tool than enrichment platform</p>

        <h2>Real-Time vs. Batch: Know What You Need</h2>

        <p>Clearbit's strength was real-time enrichment—someone fills out a form with just an email, and instantly you have their full profile. That's powerful for conversion optimization and lead routing.</p>

        <p>But many Clearbit customers used it differently: periodic batch enrichment of their database. For that use case, real-time APIs are overkill and expensive. Batch processing is simpler and cheaper.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Real-time enrichment:</strong> "Enrich leads as they come in via forms." → Apollo, ZoomInfo, or People Data Labs APIs.</li>

          <li><strong>Batch enrichment:</strong> "Enrich our existing database of 10,000 contacts." → Verum's done-for-you service is simpler and often cheaper than API-based approaches.</li>

          <li><strong>Website visitor ID:</strong> "Identify anonymous website visitors." → 6sense or Demandbase, not Clearbit's enrichment APIs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What happened to Clearbit?</h3>
          <p>Clearbit was acquired by HubSpot in late 2023. The product continues to operate, but it's becoming increasingly integrated into the HubSpot ecosystem. Non-HubSpot users may want to evaluate alternatives as the product becomes more HubSpot-centric.</p>

          <h3>What is the best Clearbit alternative?</h3>
          <p>For real-time API enrichment: Apollo or ZoomInfo have strong enrichment APIs. For batch enrichment without technical overhead: Verum offers done-for-you data services. For website visitor identification: 6sense or Demandbase offer similar features. The best choice depends on whether you need real-time enrichment, batch processing, or visitor identification.</p>

          <h3>Do I need technical resources to use Clearbit alternatives?</h3>
          <p>Most Clearbit alternatives with API-first approaches (like ZoomInfo's enrichment API) require technical implementation. Verum is different—we're a done-for-you service. You export your data, we enrich it, you import the results. No API integration, no developers needed.</p>

          <h3>Can Verum replace Clearbit for form enrichment?</h3>
          <p>Not for real-time form enrichment—Verum does batch processing, not instant lookups. But if you were using Clearbit mainly for periodic database enrichment, Verum can replace that workflow without the technical overhead.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Try a Simpler Approach</h2>

        <p>If you're looking at Clearbit alternatives because you're tired of managing API integrations or paying per-call for batch enrichment, Verum offers a different model: send us your data, we do the work, you get clean, enriched data back.</p>
