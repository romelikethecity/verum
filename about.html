      <h2>We're Disrupting Data Services and Agencies With AI</h2>
      <p>For decades, data cleaning, enrichment, and analysis meant hiring agencies or services companies. Their model was simple: bill by the hour, work slowly, scope creep every project into a five-figure engagement.</p>
      <p>A "simple" data cleaning project would take 6 weeks and cost $12,000. That's 80 hours at $150/hour. And there was no incentive to work faster. Slower meant more revenue.</p>
      <p>We watched this happen over and over. Companies paid premium rates for contractors copy-pasting between spreadsheets, manually researching LinkedIn profiles, making the same formatting mistakes at 4pm on Fridays that they'd catch Monday morning.</p>
      <p><strong>That model is dead. We killed it with AI.</strong></p>

      <h2>We Figured Out How AI Can Supercharge Data Operations</h2>
      <p>Most companies are still figuring out what to do with AI. We've already figured it out for B2B data.</p>
      <p>We built AI agents purpose-built for data cleaning, enrichment, and analysis. They understand contact data, company hierarchies, job title normalization, and the dozens of other problems that plague CRM databases. Not generic AI tools. Purpose-built systems for this specific problem.</p>
      <p>These agents work 24/7. They don't get tired. They don't make Friday afternoon mistakes. They don't bill you extra for "scope changes" when your data is messier than expected.</p>
      <p>What used to take weeks now takes hours. What used to cost $10,000+ now costs hundreds. Quality is better because AI processes every record with the same precision. No variance based on who's working your project that day.</p>

      <h2>Why We Charge for Outcomes, Not Hours</h2>
      <p>Hourly billing creates perverse incentives. Bill by the hour, you're incentivized to work slowly. Find additional scope. Schedule unnecessary meetings.</p>
      <p>We charge per record. You know exactly what you'll pay before we start. Our incentive is to deliver quality results fast, because that's how we make money and build reputation. Your win is our win.</p>
      <p>This is only possible because of AI. Without AI, per-record pricing would mean losing money on complex projects. With AI, we process 100,000 records with the same efficiency as 1,000.</p>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI is making things cheaper and faster.</strong> Data quality used to be a luxury for enterprises with six-figure budgets. Not anymore.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcomes over hours.</strong> The legacy model charged for time. We charge for results. That alignment changes everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed is a feature.</strong> Every day with bad data is a day of lost revenue. Legacy timelines measured in weeks were a symptom of a broken model, not an inherent requirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Human verification, AI execution.</strong> AI does the heavy lifting. Humans ensure quality. This combination beats pure AI and pure human approaches.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Company</h2>
      <p>Verum (Latin for "truth") was founded to bring truth to B2B data. We're a small team that believes the services industry has been overcharging and underdelivering for too long.</p>
      <p>We're not building a platform you need to learn. We're not locking you into annual contracts. We just want to clean your data, fast, at a fair price.</p>

      <h2>Ready to Switch?</h2>
      <p>If you've been burned by agencies that overpromised and underdelivered, or if you've been putting off data cleaning because the quotes were too high, <a href="/#contact">let's talk</a>.</p>
      <p>Send us a sample of your data. We'll show you what AI-powered data operations looks like and what it costs. No multi-week scoping process. No surprise invoices.</p>
