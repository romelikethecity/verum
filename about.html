      <h2>The Problem We Saw</h2>
      <p>Every B2B company we've worked with has the same problem: their data is a mess. Duplicates everywhere. Missing fields. Contacts who left their jobs two years ago. And everyone pretends it's fine because fixing it seems impossible.</p>
      <p>But it's not fine. Bad data costs real money. Sales reps chase dead leads. Marketing campaigns bounce. Forecasts are fiction. And the ops team spends more time cleaning spreadsheets than building systems.</p>

      <h2>Why We Built Verum</h2>
      <p>Verum (Latin for "truth") was founded to solve this problem. We combine automated data cleaning with comprehensive enrichment from 50+ sources to give you data you can actually trust.</p>
      <p>We're not a self-serve tool that dumps the work on you. We're not an expensive agency that takes months to deliver. We're the fast, reliable option that gets your data cleaned and enriched so your team can focus on what they do best.</p>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Truth matters.</strong> Your decisions are only as good as your data. We obsess over accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity wins.</strong> Data cleaning shouldn't require a PhD. We make it easy.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed creates value.</strong> Every day with bad data is a day of lost revenue. We work fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcomes over features.</strong> We care about your results, not our feature list.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
