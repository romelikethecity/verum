        <h2>The MarTech Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's pipeline review. Your SDR team is working through a list of marketing leaders at mid-market companies. Perfect ICP. Great intent signals. Should be solid meetings.</p>

        <p>Except the CMO at target account #1 left for a startup three months ago. The VP of Demand Gen at #2 got laid off in the last round of cuts. The Director of Marketing Ops at #3 is now the CMO somewhere else. Your "hot leads" are sending emails to people who won't see them.</p>

        <p>Marketing leadership turns over faster than almost any other function. Your data can't keep up.</p>

        <h3>Marketing executives move constantly</h3>
        <p>CMO tenure averages around 18 months. VP and Director level marketing roles aren't much more stable. Budget cuts, reorganizations, pivots to "growth" structures. The marketing leader you identified six months ago has a significant chance of being somewhere else today.</p>

        <h3>The martech landscape creates complexity</h3>
        <p>Over 11,000 marketing technology solutions exist. Your prospects are already using some of them. But your CRM doesn't tell you which ones. You're pitching blind, not knowing if they're already using a competitor or a complementary tool you could integrate with.</p>

        <h3>Company data fragments across systems</h3>
        <p>Your prospects have marketing data scattered everywhere. CRM, marketing automation, analytics, data warehouse. Each system has different contact information, different company hierarchies, different account statuses. You're selling to companies you don't fully understand.</p>

        <h3>SDR research time kills productivity</h3>
        <p>Every hour your SDRs spend researching whether a contact is still at a company is an hour not spent on outreach. Manual verification doesn't scale. But bad data tanks reply rates and damages sender reputation.</p>

        <p>Every email to someone who left is a missed opportunity. Every call to a disconnected number is time wasted. Every prospect whose tech stack you don't know is a pitch that might miss the mark. In a crowded martech market, you can't afford to be working from yesterday's data.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves MarTech Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a research team to know if your prospects are still employed. Verum takes your prospect databases, your CRM exports, and your lead lists, and makes them accurate. We verify contacts, enrich company data, and add technographic intelligence. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating titles, and verifying current employers. We catch the turnover before your SDRs waste time on dead leads.</p>
        <p><strong>For martech teams:</strong> Know when your champion moves to a new company. Stop emailing CMOs who left months ago.</p>

        <h3>Technographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>What marketing automation platform are they using? CRM? CDP? Analytics tools? We append technology stack data so you can tailor your pitch to their existing infrastructure.</p>
        <p><strong>For martech teams:</strong> Lead with relevant integration stories. Know if they're using a competitor before you pitch.</p>

        <h3>Company Intelligence Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Marketing team headcount? Funding stage? We fill in the firmographic gaps that make targeting and segmentation work.</p>
        <p><strong>For martech teams:</strong> Prioritize prospects with marketing teams big enough to need your solution.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before delivery. Marketing titles vary wildly across companies. We catch what algorithms miss.</p>

        <h2>What MarTech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Improve outreach efficiency.</strong> When your contact data is accurate, emails land in actual inboxes. Reply rates go up. Spam complaints go down. Your sender reputation stays healthy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track marketing leaders across companies.</strong> When your champion moves to a new company, that's a warm lead at a new account. Clean data lets you follow relationships as people move.</li>

          <li><strong>Personalize based on tech stack.</strong> When you know what tools they're already using, you can lead with integration value. Better personalization means better conversion.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by actual fit signals.</strong> Marketing team size, technology maturity, funding stage. Better firmographic data means better targeting and less wasted effort.</li>

          <li><strong>Give SDRs time back.</strong> When contact research is already done, your team can focus on outreach and relationship building instead of LinkedIn stalking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? HubSpot? Outreach? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Marketing leadership turns over constantly. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep your data current. Or not. Your call.</p>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Clean your data before the big outbound push, not after.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Every project gets both.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Project-based pricing fits startup budgets.</li>

        <h2>Common Questions About MarTech Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any system.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify a company's marketing tech stack?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We enrich company records with technographic data including marketing automation platforms, CRMs, CDPs, analytics tools, and more. Know what your prospects are already using before you pitch.</p>

          <h3>What marketing titles do you track?</h3>
          <p>The full spectrum. CMO, VP Marketing, VP Demand Gen, Director Marketing Ops, Head of Growth, Marketing Manager, and dozens of variations. We normalize them so your segmentation works.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of leads and now that data is stale? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before a funding push, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We understand your prospect list is competitive intelligence.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with seed-stage martech startups and established platforms. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of scale.</p>
