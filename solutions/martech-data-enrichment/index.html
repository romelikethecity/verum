        <h2>The MarTech Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling marketing technology. Automation, analytics, attribution, personalization. Your buyers are marketing leaders who get pitched constantly. Generic outreach doesn't work. You need precise targeting and relevant positioning.</p>

        <p>MarTech buyer data has unique challenges. Marketing teams are bombarded by vendors. Contact information is protected. Marketing tech stacks are complex and constantly changing. And the signals that indicate buying readiness, like contract renewals and dissatisfaction with current tools, aren't publicly visible. Your SDRs spend hours researching each account.</p>

        <h3>Marketing leaders are hard to reach</h3>
        <p>CMOs and VPs of Marketing get hundreds of vendor pitches. They're protective of their time and contact information. Without verified direct contact data and a relevant angle, you're not getting through the noise.</p>

        <h3>Buying committees are large</h3>
        <p>A marketing platform purchase might involve the CMO, VP of Demand Gen, Marketing Ops lead, IT for integrations, and finance for budget approval. You need the full buying committee, not just a single contact.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack determines positioning</h3>
        <p>If you're selling marketing tech, knowing their current stack is essential. Are they on HubSpot or Marketo? What CRM? What CDP? This context determines competitive positioning and integration messaging.</p>

        <h3>Marketing investment varies wildly</h3>
        <p>Some companies invest heavily in marketing. Others have minimal budgets. You need signals that indicate marketing investment: team size, ad spend, active campaigns. Without these signals, you're qualifying blind.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that martech sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage companies investing in marketing.</p>

        <h3>Marketing leader contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for marketing decision-makers. CMOs, VPs of Marketing, Heads of Demand Gen, Marketing Ops directors, Growth leads. The people who buy marketing technology, with contact info that works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for marketing buyers.</p>

        <h3>Buying committee mapping</h3>
        <p>We identify both the marketing practitioners who evaluate tools and the executives and stakeholders who approve purchases. Marketing leadership, IT for integrations, finance for budget approval.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multi-contact enrichment showing the full buying committee at target accounts.</p>

        <h3>Marketing tech stack</h3>
        <p>MAP, CRM, CDP, analytics, advertising platforms, attribution tools. We identify what marketing technologies companies are using so you can qualify fit and position against current solutions.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data showing current marketing systems across key categories.</p>

        <h3>Marketing investment signals</h3>
        <p>Marketing team headcount, advertising spend estimates, marketing-focused job postings. These signals indicate companies actively investing in marketing and likely to have budget for tools.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Marketing investment signals for qualification and prioritization.</p>

        <h3>Company firmographics</h3>
        <p>Revenue, employee count, growth trajectory, industry. The metrics that determine fit and deal size. Combined with marketing-specific signals, you get a complete qualification picture.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firmographic profiles for target companies.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">

          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With the full buying committee mapped, your reps engage marketing, IT, and finance simultaneously.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by firmographics.</strong> Company data helps you instantly qualify whether a company is in your target tier.</li>
