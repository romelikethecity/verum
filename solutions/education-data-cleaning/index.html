        <h2>The Education Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to schools, districts, or universities. Your CRM holds years of institution records and administrator contacts. But that data has become unreliable.</p>

        <p>Education data has unique challenges. Administrators turn over frequently, especially principals. Schools change names, merge, or close. District structures reorganize. And your sales team has added records from multiple sources over years, creating duplicates and inconsistencies.</p>

        <h3>Institutions are duplicated</h3>
        <p>"Lincoln Elementary" and "Lincoln Elementary School" and "Lincoln ES" are all in your database. Maybe they're the same school. Maybe they're different schools in different districts. When you can't trust institution data, your territory planning and account coverage suffer.</p>

        <h3>Administrator turnover is high</h3>
        <p>Principals and department heads change roles frequently. The superintendent you pitched last year retired. The curriculum director moved to another district. Education has high administrator turnover, and every change creates stale contact data.</p>

        <h3>District affiliations are outdated</h3>
        <p>Districts merge, split, and reorganize. Charter networks acquire schools. Your database shows institutional affiliations that were accurate years ago but don't reflect current reality. District-level sales motions fail when the data is wrong.</p>

        <h3>Contact information is inconsistent</h3>
        <p>Some contacts have school emails, some have personal, some have both. Phone extensions change. Buildings move. Your outreach fails when you're reaching out to contacts with outdated information.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Education Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the specific challenges of education data. Institution hierarchies that matter for sales. Administrator turnover that's faster than most industries. The importance of accurate district associations.</p>

        <h3>Institution deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match institution records across names, NCES IDs, addresses, and district affiliations. We understand that schools get listed multiple ways. We consolidate duplicates while preserving complete engagement history.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per institution with complete history, plus merge logs showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Administrator contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses and phone numbers for principals, superintendents, and department heads. We flag contacts who've left and identify current administrators where possible. Education contacts change frequently, so current data matters.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with role change flags for re-engagement.</p>

        <h3>District hierarchy cleanup</h3>
        <p>We normalize district associations, update charter network affiliations, and correct institutional relationships. Your district-level sales data reflects current organizational structures.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Accurate district and network affiliations enabling proper territory management.</p>

        <h3>Institution classification</h3>
        <p>We standardize institution types, grade levels, and enrollment data. K-12, higher ed, public, private, charter. Clean classification data enables accurate segmentation and targeting.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent institution classifications for proper market segmentation.</p>

        <h2>What Education Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>See true institution coverage.</strong> Deduplicated records show which schools you've actually engaged versus duplicates inflating your market coverage.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach current administrators.</strong> Validated contacts mean your outreach reaches the principals and department heads who can make decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Execute district-level strategies.</strong> Accurate district affiliations enable coordinated district sales motions and proper territory management.</li>
          <li><strong>Segment accurately.</strong> Clean classification data means your campaigns reach the right institution types with relevant messaging.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Clean data means your opportunity and revenue forecasts reflect real market coverage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull institution and contact data from your CRM. We work with exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, and specialized education sales platforms.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, stale contacts, and district issues. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex institution matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your sales team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>
