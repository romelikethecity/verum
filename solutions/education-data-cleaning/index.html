        <h2>The Education Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell EdTech, curriculum, professional development, or services to schools. Your CRM has thousands of schools and districts. But when your sales team actually tries to use this data, the problems multiply.</p>

        <p>That superintendent you've been nurturing? Retired last summer. The principal who showed interest? Moved to a different district. The technology director who requested a demo? The position was eliminated in budget cuts. Your reps are chasing contacts who no longer have decision-making authority.</p>

        <p>Education data has unique challenges. And most EdTech companies just accept the chaos.</p>

        <h3>Administrator turnover is relentless</h3>
        <p>Principal turnover runs around 20% annually. Superintendents move or retire constantly. Curriculum directors change positions. The decision-makers you mapped last school year might all be different by fall. Your carefully built relationships need constant updating.</p>

        <h3>School and district data is inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"Lincoln Elementary," "Lincoln Elem," "Lincoln Elementary School," and "Lincoln ES" might all be the same school in your CRM—or four different schools. Districts merge, schools close, charters open. Your data doesn't keep up with the constant restructuring.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists make it worse</h3>
        <p>You've bought school databases, administrator lists, district contact data. Each list has different formats, different levels of accuracy, different ages. Now you have the same school five times with conflicting information. Nobody knows which record is right.</p>

        <h3>Buying cycles don't forgive bad data</h3>
        <p>Education buying happens in narrow windows tied to budget cycles and school years. When you reach out to a decision-maker who left, you've lost that window. Your competitors with clean data are already in conversations while your team discovers their contact is wrong.</p>

        <p>In EdTech sales, timing is everything. Bad data means missed windows, wasted outreach, and deals that go to competitors who showed up with the right information.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See How Clean Data Transforms EdTech Sales</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Education Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy school and district database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Administrator Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that contacts are still at the schools and districts you think they are. Retired administrators, those who moved districts, and eliminated positions get flagged so your team stops chasing them.</p>
        <p><strong>For EdTech sales teams:</strong> Reach actual decision-makers. Stop nurturing contacts who retired. Know when administrators move before the buying window closes.</p>

        <h3>School and District Deduplication</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when school names are entered differently or data came from different sources. We merge intelligently, creating one clean record per institution.</p>
        <p><strong>For EdTech sales teams:</strong> One record per school. No more confusion about which entry is correct. Clear territory assignments and account ownership.</p>

        <h3>Email and Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We check every email against multiple validation sources. District emails that bounce, personal emails that shouldn't be used, and invalid addresses get flagged before they hurt your outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>For EdTech sales teams:</strong> Higher email deliverability. Fewer bounces. Outreach that actually reaches inboxes.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize school names, district names, job titles, and grade levels into consistent formats. "K-8" and "K through 8" become standardized. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For EdTech sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by grade level, school type, or district size. Targeting rules that fire correctly. Personalization that doesn't look broken.</p>

        <h2>What EdTech Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Hit buying windows.</strong> When administrator contacts are current, you reach decision-makers during budget season. Timing is everything in education sales—clean data makes timing possible.</li>

          <li><strong>Build accurate territory maps.</strong> When duplicates are removed and schools standardized, territory assignments actually make sense. No more fighting over which rep owns which record.</li>

          <li><strong>Run effective campaigns.</strong> Clean segmentation means your campaigns reach the right grade levels, school types, and decision-maker roles. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated data means your opportunity counts are real. Forecasting works when the underlying data represents actual schools and current contacts.</li>

          <li><strong>Look professional.</strong> No more emails to retired superintendents. No more confusion about school names. Your team looks prepared and informed in every interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of what cleaning can realistically accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your data sources. CRM export? Purchased lists? We've worked with all types of education market data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your school database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Education data goes stale every school year. We recommend cleaning before fall outreach and before budget season. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Education Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of education data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>K-12 administrator databases, higher ed contact lists, district-level data, school board contacts, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach educational institutions.</p>

          <h3>Can you help with administrator turnover?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate contacts against current employment data and flag records where administrators appear to have moved. This is especially valuable in education where principal and superintendent turnover is high.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you match schools to NCES IDs?</h3>
          <p>We can help standardize school names and assist with NCES matching as part of the cleaning process. This helps ensure your records align with official school identifiers.</p>

          <h3>When should we clean our education data?</h3>
          <p>Before fall outreach (after summer turnover settles) and before budget season are ideal times. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after purchasing new lists.</p>
