        <h2>The SaaS Growth Analysis Problem</h2>

        <p>SaaS companies have more data than most industries. Product usage, billing history, support tickets, NPS scores. But translating that data into go-to-market decisions is harder than it looks.</p>

        <p>Most SaaS companies segment by company size or industry. But these broad categories miss the patterns that actually predict customer success. A 50-person company in one segment might have 10x the LTV of a 500-person company in another.</p>

        <h3>Acquisition vs. expansion trade-offs</h3>
        <p>Should you invest in acquiring new logos or expanding existing accounts? The answer depends on which segments have expansion potential and which are already maxed out. Generic "land and expand" strategies miss these nuances.</p>

        <h3>PLG conversion mysteries</h3>
        <p>If you have a free tier or trial, thousands of users are in your funnel. But which ones will convert? Product usage data contains signals, but extracting them requires analysis most teams don't have time for.</p>

        <h3>Churn prediction complexity</h3>
        <p>By the time customers show obvious churn signals, it's often too late. Early indicators exist in your data—usage patterns, support interactions, engagement metrics—but finding them requires looking across multiple data sources.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See What's Hiding in Your SaaS Data</a>
        </div>

        <h2>What SaaS Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Segment</h3>
        <p>Which customer types have the highest LTV? Best expansion rates? Lowest churn? We analyze across firmographic, technographic, and behavioral dimensions to identify your true ICP.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers using Slack + Salesforce have 2.5x higher retention than those on Microsoft stack. Integration depth predicts success more than company size."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Contraction Patterns</h3>
        <p>Net revenue retention varies dramatically by segment. We identify which customer types expand, which contract, and what behaviors predict each outcome.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers who activate 3+ integrations in first 30 days have 180% NRR vs. 95% for single-integration users. Integration adoption is the key expansion lever."</p>

        <h3>PLG Conversion Analysis</h3>
        <p>For product-led companies, we analyze free-to-paid conversion patterns. Which users convert? What product actions predict conversion? When should sales engage?</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Users who invite 2+ team members within 7 days convert at 4x the rate. This is a stronger signal than feature usage or time in product."</p>

        <h3>Churn Early Warning Signals</h3>
        <p>We identify the leading indicators of churn—often 3-6 months before cancellation—so you can intervene while there's still time.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Decline in weekly active users by 20% predicts churn with 78% accuracy 90 days out. Support ticket velocity is not predictive."</p>

        <h2>SaaS-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Product usage patterns.</strong> Feature adoption, usage frequency, breadth vs. depth of engagement. How does usage correlate with retention and expansion?</li>

          <li><strong>Customer journey stage.</strong> Trial, onboarding, expansion-ready, at-risk. Where do customers fall and what predicts movement between stages?</li>

          <li><strong>Tech stack compatibility.</strong> Which CRM, marketing automation, or productivity tools correlate with customer success? Integration patterns often predict outcomes.</li>

          <li><strong>Company growth signals.</strong> Hiring velocity, funding events, expansion indicators. Fast-growing companies may have different patterns than stable ones.</li>

          <li><strong>Buying motion.</strong> Self-serve vs. sales-assisted vs. enterprise. Each motion has different economics and success patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Use case and department.</strong> Who's using your product and for what? Different use cases may have very different success profiles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your SaaS model, current segmentation, and the questions you're trying to answer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share CRM data, product analytics, billing history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions, looking for patterns that predict customer success, expansion, and churn.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights with specific recommendations for targeting, pricing, and customer success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help translate findings into lead scoring models, health scores, and go-to-market strategy adjustments.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What SaaS data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your SaaS sales and customer data to identify your ideal customer profile, segment accounts by expansion potential, predict churn, and find patterns in PLG vs. sales-led conversions. Output is actionable recommendations for go-to-market strategy.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze product-led growth conversion patterns?</h3>
          <p>Yes. For PLG companies, we analyze which free or trial users convert to paid, what behaviors predict conversion, and how to identify sales-ready accounts within your product usage data.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle SaaS expansion and contraction analysis?</h3>
          <p>We look at net revenue retention by segment, identifying which customer types expand vs. contract. This includes seat expansion, tier upgrades, and add-on purchases. Understanding expansion patterns is often more valuable than acquisition analysis for SaaS.</p>

          <h3>What data sources do you need?</h3>
          <p>Ideally: CRM (deals and accounts), billing/subscription data, and product analytics. We can work with partial data but the more complete the picture, the stronger the insights.</p>
