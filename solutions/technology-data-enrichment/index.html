        <h2>The Technology Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to tech companies. Startups, scale-ups, enterprises. Your CRM has company names and maybe some product signup data. That's not enough to run an effective sales motion in the crowded tech market.</p>

        <p>Tech buyer data has unique challenges. Engineers are notoriously hard to reach through cold outreach. Decision-making is distributed across technical and business roles. And the signals that indicate buying readiness, like funding rounds and hiring, change quickly. Your SDRs spend hours researching each account before they can start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>Technical buyers are hard to reach</h3>
        <p>Engineers and technical leaders don't respond to generic sales emails. They block cold calls. Their emails are protected. Without verified direct contact information and the context to personalize your approach, you're not breaking through.</p>

        <h3>Buying committees are complex</h3>
        <p>A developer tools purchase might involve the VP of Engineering, a platform team lead, DevOps, and procurement. You need the full buying committee, not just a single contact. And you need to understand who evaluates versus who approves budget.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic data changes fast</h3>
        <p>Tech companies grow, contract, pivot, and get acquired at faster rates than any other industry. The headcount and funding data from six months ago is probably wrong. You need current data to qualify effectively.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack matters for positioning</h3>
        <p>If you're selling infrastructure or developer tools, knowing what they're currently using is essential. You need to know if they're an AWS or GCP shop, what languages they use, what monitoring tools they have. But companies don't advertise this.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that tech sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage technology companies.</p>

        <h3>Technical buyer contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for technical decision-makers. VPs of Engineering, CTOs, Platform leads, DevOps managers, IT directors. The people who actually evaluate and buy technology, with contact info that works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for technical buyers.</p>

        <h3>Buying committee mapping</h3>
        <p>We identify both technical evaluators and business decision-makers. Engineering leadership, procurement, finance stakeholders. You'll know who's involved in the decision and their roles.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multi-contact enrichment showing the full buying committee at target accounts.</p>

        <h3>Funding and growth data</h3>
        <p>Recent funding rounds, investors, valuation signals, headcount growth, hiring velocity. These metrics indicate budget availability and buying urgency. A company that just raised Series B is different from one that's flat.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Funding history and growth signals for qualification and prioritization.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack</h3>
        <p>Cloud infrastructure, development tools, monitoring, security, analytics platforms. We identify what technologies companies are using so you can qualify fit and position against competitors.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data showing current technologies across key categories.</p>

        <h3>Hiring signals</h3>
        <p>Open engineering roles, team growth patterns, and hiring velocity. Companies actively hiring engineers often need better tools to support that growth. Hiring data helps you time outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Hiring activity data indicating growth and potential budget.</p>

        <h2>What Tech Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach technical buyers directly.</strong> With verified contact info for engineering leaders, you connect with decision-makers instead of getting lost in company info@ emails.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize by funding stage.</strong> Recent funding indicates budget. Enriched funding data lets you focus on companies that can actually buy.</li>
          <li><strong>Position against current stack.</strong> "I see you're using Datadog" opens a different conversation than generic outreach. Tech stack data enables relevant positioning.</li>
          <li><strong>Time outreach to growth.</strong> Companies hiring rapidly need tools to scale. Hiring signals help you reach out when there's urgency.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With both technical and business contacts, your reps engage the full buying committee simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Company names, domains, whatever accounts you're targeting. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Technical contacts? Full buying committee? Funding data? Tech stack? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>
