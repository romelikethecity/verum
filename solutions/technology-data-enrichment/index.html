        <h2>The Technology Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's pipeline review. Your SDR team is working a list of 500 tech companies that downloaded your whitepaper six months ago. Good intent signal. Should be quality meetings.</p>

        <p>Except company #1 ran out of runway and shut down. Company #2 pivoted from B2B to B2C. Company #3 got acquired and the entire engineering team was let go. Company #4's VP of Engineering, the person who downloaded your content, is now at a different company entirely. Your "hot leads" are pointing at ghosts.</p>

        <p>Tech moves faster than any other industry. Your database is already out of date.</p>

        <h3>Startup mortality creates constant churn</h3>
        <p>Most startups fail. The ones that survive often pivot dramatically, sometimes multiple times. That Series A company you identified as a prospect might not exist in any recognizable form a year later. Or at all. Your prospect list is accumulating dead companies faster than you realize.</p>

        <h3>M&A activity reshapes your market constantly</h3>
        <p>Tech acquisitions happen constantly. When companies get acquired, contacts scatter. Some stay with the acquirer. Some leave. Some end up at the acquiring company but in completely different roles. Your carefully built contact list fragments with every deal announcement you missed.</p>

        <h3>Tech layoffs come in waves</h3>
        <p>The tech industry experiences hiring booms and layoff waves. When a company cuts 20% of their workforce, there's a good chance your contact was in that 20%. Especially engineering leaders, product managers, and technical decision-makers. Your champion might be job hunting, not buying software.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack data goes stale quickly</h3>
        <p>Companies change their technology constantly. That company using a competitor's tool last year might have switched. That startup you passed on because they weren't using your ecosystem might have migrated. Without current technographic data, you're making targeting decisions on outdated information.</p>

        <p>Every email to a dead company is time wasted. Every pitch to someone who got laid off is a meeting that won't happen. Every prospect whose tech stack you don't know is a conversation that might miss the mark. In a market moving this fast, yesterday's data is already wrong.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Technology Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a research team to know if a company is still operating. Verum takes your prospect databases, your CRM exports, and your lead lists, and makes them accurate. We verify companies, track contact changes, and enrich records with technographic data. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating titles, and verifying current employers. We catch the layoffs and job changes before your SDRs waste time on dead leads.</p>
        <p><strong>For tech teams:</strong> Know when your champion moves to a new company. Stop emailing people who got laid off months ago.</p>

        <h3>Company Verification</h3>
        <p>Is that startup still operating? Did they pivot? Get acquired? We verify company status so you know which prospects are still viable before you invest outreach effort.</p>
        <p><strong>For tech teams:</strong> Remove dead companies from your database. Know which startups actually survived their last runway extension.</p>

        <h3>Technographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>What's their tech stack? Cloud provider? Development tools? Business applications? We append technology data so you can tailor your pitch and identify fit.</p>
        <p><strong>For tech teams:</strong> Lead with relevant integration stories. Know if they're using a competitor before you pitch.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing employee count? Funding stage? Revenue range? We fill in the gaps that make your targeting and segmentation actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For tech teams:</strong> Know which companies have the budget and team size to be real prospects.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before delivery. Tech company data has quirks. Holding companies, subsidiaries, multiple product lines under one roof. We catch what algorithms miss.</p>

        <h2>What Technology Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Improve outreach efficiency.</strong> When your contact data is accurate, emails land in actual inboxes. Reply rates go up. Spam complaints go down. Your sender reputation stays healthy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track champions across companies.</strong> When your contact moves to a new company, that's a warm lead at a new account. Clean data lets you follow relationships as people change jobs.</li>

          <li><strong>Personalize based on tech stack.</strong> When you know what tools they're already using, you can lead with integration value. Better personalization means better conversion.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by actual fit signals.</strong> Funding stage, employee count, growth rate. Better firmographic data means better targeting and less wasted effort on companies that aren't ready to buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Stop wasting SDR time on dead leads.</strong> When company and contact research is already done, your team can focus on outreach instead of LinkedIn stalking and company research.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? HubSpot? Outreach? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Tech industry data changes constantly. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Technology Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any system.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify a company's technology stack?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We enrich company records with technographic data including cloud providers, development frameworks, business applications, and infrastructure tools. Know what your prospects are using before you pitch.</p>

          <h3>Do you track funding and company changes?</h3>
          <p>We can flag companies that have raised funding, been acquired, or show signs of significant change. We don't replace dedicated funding databases, but we provide the signals that matter for sales targeting.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of leads and now that data is stale? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before a funding push, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We understand your prospect list is competitive intelligence.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with seed-stage startups and enterprise tech companies. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of scale.</p>
