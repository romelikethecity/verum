        <h2>The Real Estate Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to real estate professionals. Agents, brokers, team leaders, brokerage owners. Your CRM has tens of thousands of records. But real estate is one of the most fluid industries for contact data.</p>

        <p>Agents switch brokerages constantly, chasing better splits or following team leaders. Some leave the industry entirely. Licenses expire. And every trade show, MLS data feed, and purchased list adds more duplicates to your database.</p>

        <h3>Agents change brokerages constantly</h3>
        <p>The agent you talked to at Keller Williams is now at eXp. The Compass team leader just moved to Sotheby's. Every brokerage change means your contact data is wrong: wrong email domain, wrong office address, wrong phone number. You're reaching out to people at companies they no longer work for.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates pile up from everywhere</h3>
        <p>MLS data feeds, Inman Connect badge scans, purchased agent lists, referral partner uploads. Every data source creates new records without checking if the agent already exists. Now you have three records for the same top producer, each with different information.</p>

        <h3>License data gets stale</h3>
        <p>Agents let licenses lapse. Some move states and get new licenses. Others leave the industry entirely. Your CRM doesn't know the difference between an active agent and someone who hasn't renewed in two years.</p>

        <h3>Brokerage names are inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"Keller Williams" and "KW" and "Keller Williams Realty" are all the same company. Good luck running a brokerage-level campaign when you can't count how many agents you have at each one.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Real Estate Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the unique challenges of real estate data. License numbers, brokerage relationships, MLS associations, and the constant movement between companies.</p>

        <h3>License validation</h3>
        <p>We verify agent licenses against state real estate commission databases. Is the license active? Does it match the name in your record? We flag expired licenses, suspended agents, and mismatched data so you're only reaching out to actively licensed professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Validated license status for every agent record with flags for any issues.</p>

        <h3>Brokerage change detection</h3>
        <p>We identify when agents have moved brokerages. The record shows Coldwell Banker but they're now at Compass? We flag it and can provide their current brokerage information. You stop sending outreach to outdated affiliations.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Flagged records for brokerage changes with current affiliation data where available.</p>

        <h3>Smart deduplication</h3>
        <p>We dedupe using license numbers as the primary key, plus fuzzy matching on names and email patterns. Sarah Johnson at KW and S. Johnson at Keller Williams Realty might be the same agent. We figure that out.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per agent with the most complete, most current information.</p>

        <h3>Brokerage standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize brokerage names so "RE/MAX" and "Remax" and "RE-MAX" become one consistent entry. We understand parent company relationships and franchise structures.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized brokerage names enabling accurate account-level reporting and campaigns.</p>

        <h2>What Real Estate Tech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run brokerage-level campaigns.</strong> When brokerage data is standardized, you can target specific franchises or independent brokerages with relevant messaging.</li>
          <li><strong>Target active agents only.</strong> License validation means you're reaching licensed, practicing agents, not people who left the industry.</li>
          <li><strong>Track agent movement.</strong> When agents change brokerages, clean data helps you reconnect at their new company.</li>
          <li><strong>Maximize trade show ROI.</strong> Deduplicated post-event lists mean you're not emailing the same agent three times from different sources.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your reporting.</strong> When duplicates are gone and brokerages are standardized, your penetration metrics actually mean something.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull agent contacts from your CRM, MLS feeds, or marketing database. We work with standard exports.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, license status, brokerage inconsistencies, and email validity. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, license validation, standardization. Human review on edge cases. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes made.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Can you validate real estate licenses?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We verify agent licenses against state real estate commission databases. We check if the license is active, identify expired or suspended licenses, and flag records where the license number doesn't match the agent name.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle agents who switch brokerages?</h3>
          <p>Agents move between brokerages frequently. We identify when an agent has changed brokerages and flag outdated records. We can also track where they went, so you can update your outreach to their current brokerage.</p>

          <h3>What about duplicate agent records?</h3>
          <p>Real estate CRMs often have multiple records for the same agent from different sources. We dedupe using license numbers, name matching, and brokerage affiliations to create one clean record per agent.</p>

          <h3>How long does real estate data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most real estate data cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 100,000 records. Large agent databases or multi-state license validation may take 3-5 business days.</p>

          <h3>Do you cover commercial real estate too?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We clean data for residential and commercial real estate. Commercial has different license types and brokerage structures in some states, and we handle those distinctions.</p>
