        <h2>The Real Estate Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell software, services, or marketing to real estate companies. Your CRM contains brokerages, property management firms, commercial real estate companies, and developers. But the real estate industry is in constant motion.</p>

        <p>That top agent you've been targeting? Switched brokerages last quarter. The property management firm you built a relationship with? Acquired by a larger player. The broker on your target list? Retired from the business. Your database reflects a real estate landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Real estate data has unique challenges. High agent turnover, brokerage consolidation, and market-driven changes mean your prospect data goes stale faster than most industries.</p>

        <h3>Agents switch brokerages constantly</h3>
        <p>Real estate agents move between brokerages regularly, driven by commission splits, branding, and market conditions. The agent or team you've been targeting might be at a completely different brokerage than your CRM shows. Your outreach hits old email addresses and goes unanswered.</p>

        <h3>Brokerage consolidation reshapes the market</h3>
        <p>Independent brokerages join franchise networks. Franchise offices change hands. National brands acquire regional players. Your target account list includes brokerages that no longer exist independently or have changed ownership structures.</p>

        <h3>Market conditions drive exits</h3>
        <p>Challenging markets push agents out of the business. Brokerages close offices or shut down entirely. The database you built during a hot market includes agents who've left real estate and companies that no longer operate.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought agent databases, brokerage lists, property manager directories. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different accuracy levels. Now you have the same agent five times with different brokerages listed.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for real estate sales. A fragmented industry with high turnover means you can't afford to waste time pursuing agents who left or brokerages that closed.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Real Estate Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy real estate database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation and Brokerage Tracking</h3>
        <p>We verify that agents and brokers are still at the companies you think they are. Brokerage switches and industry exits get flagged so you can update your outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>For real estate sales teams:</strong> Stop emailing agents at their old brokerages. Know when top producers switch firms. Reach people where they actually work.</p>

        <h3>Company Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that brokerages and property management firms still operate, flag those that have closed or been acquired, and update records where we can identify successor organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>For real estate sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing brokerages that closed. Know when targets have been acquired. Focus on active companies that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names vary or data came from different sources. We handle franchise vs. independent distinctions and multi-office structures.</p>
        <p><strong>For real estate sales teams:</strong> One clean record per company and agent. Clear understanding of franchise relationships. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, business types (brokerage, property management, commercial), and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For real estate sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by company type. Target residential differently from commercial, franchises differently from independents. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Real Estate Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach agents at current brokerages.</strong> When contacts switch firms, you know about it. Your outreach hits people where they actually work, not where they used to be.</li>

          <li><strong>Focus on active companies.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on brokerages that closed or got acquired. Every account in your database represents a real company that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by company type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target residential brokerages differently from commercial firms, property managers differently from developers. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate franchise complexity.</strong> Understand which offices are independent vs. franchise-owned. Know where purchasing decisions are actually made.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of what cleaning can realistically accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your real estate database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Agent turnover never stops. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Real Estate Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of real estate data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Brokerage databases, property management contacts, commercial real estate firm data, developer contacts, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the real estate industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you track agent moves between brokerages?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We cross-reference contacts against current employment data and can flag records where agents or brokers appear to have switched firms. This is especially valuable given the high mobility in real estate.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle franchise vs. independent distinctions?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can help clarify franchise relationships and ownership structures in your data. Understanding who owns what is part of what we do.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our real estate data?</h3>
          <p>Given agent turnover rates, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant market shifts that drive industry changes.</p>
