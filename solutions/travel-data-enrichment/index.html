        <h2>The Travel Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Conference season is here. You're reaching out to corporate travel managers about group bookings and negotiated rates. Great timing. These conversations should be happening.</p>

        <p>Except the travel manager at target company #1 was laid off last year. Company #2 shifted all booking authority to an executive assistant who isn't in your system. Company #3 changed their travel policy to use a managed travel company, and your direct contact no longer makes decisions. Your outreach is landing with people who can't say yes anymore.</p>

        <p>Corporate travel structures change constantly. Your data doesn't keep up.</p>

        <h3>Travel management roles are unstable</h3>
        <p>Corporate travel management isn't always a dedicated position. Sometimes it's handled by procurement. Sometimes by HR. Sometimes by executive assistants. Sometimes by a managed travel service. The role shifts, gets combined with other responsibilities, or gets outsourced. Your contact from last year might not be doing travel anymore.</p>

        <h3>Post-pandemic restructuring changed everything</h3>
        <p>Travel policies got rewritten. Teams got restructured. Some companies brought travel management in-house. Others outsourced it. The decision-making structure for corporate travel at most companies looks nothing like it did a few years ago. Your database still reflects the old world.</p>

        <h3>Traveler contact data fragments across touchpoints</h3>
        <p>Loyalty program data. Booking history. Meeting planner contacts. Group sales records. Each system holds different information about the same people, often with conflicting details. When a frequent traveler changes jobs, some systems know, others don't.</p>

        <h3>Corporate account relationships need constant maintenance</h3>
        <p>Negotiated rates. Preferred vendor status. RFP cycles. These relationships require ongoing contact with the right people. But the people change. New travel manager. New procurement director. New executive assistant handling the CEO's travel. One turnover can undo months of relationship building.</p>

        <p>Every email to someone who changed roles is a booking you didn't get. Every pitch to a travel manager who no longer makes decisions is time wasted. Every corporate account where you don't know the current structure is revenue going to competitors. In a market this size, stale data costs real money.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Travel Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a dedicated research team to know who manages travel at your target accounts. Verum takes your corporate databases, loyalty program exports, and account files, and makes them accurate. We verify contacts, track role changes, and enrich records. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating titles, and verifying current employers. We catch the turnover before your sales team pitches to people who've moved on.</p>
        <p><strong>For travel teams:</strong> Know when your travel manager contact changes roles. Stop emailing people who no longer handle travel.</p>

        <h3>Decision-Maker Identification</h3>
        <p>Who actually controls travel spend at each account? We enrich your records with travel manager contacts, procurement decision-makers, and executive assistants who handle booking.</p>
        <p><strong>For travel teams:</strong> Know whether travel decisions are made by HR, procurement, or dedicated travel management. Reach the right person the first time.</p>

        <h3>Corporate Account Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Industry? Travel volume indicators? We fill in the firmographic gaps that help you prioritize and segment accounts.</p>
        <p><strong>For travel teams:</strong> Know which companies have the travel spend to justify negotiated rates. Focus on accounts with real potential.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before delivery. Travel data has quirks. Parent companies versus subsidiaries. Regional versus global travel programs. We catch what algorithms miss.</p>

        <h2>What Travel & Hospitality Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Improve corporate sales efficiency.</strong> When your account data is accurate, outreach lands with people who can actually make decisions. Less time chasing, more time closing.</li>

          <li><strong>Track relationships across job changes.</strong> When a travel manager you know moves to a new company, that's a warm lead at a new account. Clean data lets you follow relationships as people move.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate account structures efficiently.</strong> Know whether to contact the travel manager, procurement, HR, or the executive assistant. Spend less time researching, more time selling.</li>

          <li><strong>Maintain loyalty program value.</strong> When frequent travelers change jobs, their loyalty status matters. Clean data helps you maintain those relationships at their new companies.</li>

          <li><strong>Prioritize group and meeting business.</strong> Enriched account data helps you identify companies with the meeting volume and travel spend to justify your attention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your systems, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? Custom CRM? Loyalty platform? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Corporate travel contacts change constantly. We can run quarterly refreshes before major RFP seasons or conference periods. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Why Travel & Hospitality Leaders Choose Verum</h2>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Clean your data before conference season, not during.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Every project gets both.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Project-based pricing fits seasonal travel sales cycles.</li>

          <li><strong>We understand travel.</strong> Travel managers versus travel agents. Corporate versus leisure. Group versus transient. We know the domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About Travel Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any system.</p>

          <h3>Can you help identify corporate travel managers and decision-makers?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We enrich company records with travel manager contacts, procurement decision-makers, and executive assistants who handle travel booking. Know who controls travel spend before you pitch.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with both corporate and leisure travel data?</h3>
          <p>We work across the travel ecosystem. Corporate accounts, meeting planners, travel agencies, loyalty programs. If you're selling travel services, we can clean your customer and prospect data.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of customer relationships and that data is stale? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before RFP season, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. Your customer relationships are competitive intelligence. We treat them that way.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with boutique properties and global hotel chains. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of scale.</p>
