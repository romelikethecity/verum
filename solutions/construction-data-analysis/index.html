        <h2>The Construction Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>Construction is a massive, fragmented industry. General contractors, specialty subs, residential builders, commercial developers, heavy civil contractors. Project types range from single-family homes to billion-dollar infrastructure. You can't pursue them all with equal intensity.</p>

        <p>Most companies selling to construction segment by obvious factors: annual revenue, employee count, maybe commercial vs. residential. But these broad categories hide the patterns that actually predict success. A regional commercial GC might be worth 5x a national residential builder of similar revenue.</p>

        <p>Which contractor types have the highest win rates? Where do project types correlate with deal velocity? Which segments expand after initial purchase? Your historical data contains these answers, but extracting them requires analysis most teams don't have bandwidth for.</p>

        <h3>Revenue doesn't tell the whole story</h3>
        <p>A $100M commercial general contractor and a $100M residential builder have completely different project economics, technology needs, and buying processes. Treating them the same wastes resources and misses opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Project type matters more than company size</h3>
        <p>Contractors specializing in complex projects (healthcare, data centers, industrial) often adopt technology faster than those doing simpler work. Project complexity predicts technology fit better than annual revenue.</p>

        <h3>Geographic patterns drive everything</h3>
        <p>Construction is intensely local. A contractor crushing it in Texas has no relevance to your Florida market. Understanding regional patterns helps you allocate field resources and time market entry.</p>

        <h2>What Construction Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not dashboards. Recommendations you can act on.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Segment</h3>
        <p>Which contractor types are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across segments to identify where you should focus.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Mid-market commercial GCs ($50M&#8209;$200M revenue) have 3x higher LTV than large national contractors. They implement faster and have higher user adoption."</p>

        <h3>Project Type Analysis</h3>
        <p>Does project type correlate with success? What about project complexity or typical contract size? We identify the sweet spots where your solution delivers the most value.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Contractors focused on healthcare and education projects close 40% faster than those doing retail or hospitality. Complex compliance requirements drive technology adoption."</p>

        <h3>Geographic Coverage Patterns</h3>
        <p>We analyze how regional concentration correlates with buying behavior. Single-market contractors vs. multi-state operators have different needs and decision processes.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Contractors operating in 2&#8209;4 states have highest NRR. Single-state operators don't need collaboration tools; national operators have too much complexity."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Churn Indicators</h3>
        <p>Which customers expand after initial purchase? Which churn? We identify the characteristics and behaviors that predict post-sale trajectory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Contractors who connect their accounting system within 30 days have 65% higher retention. Delayed integrations predict eventual churn regardless of initial deal size."</p>

        <h2>Construction-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Company type.</strong> General contractors, specialty subcontractors, developers, design-build firms, construction managers. Each has distinct buying patterns and technology needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Project types.</strong> Commercial, residential, industrial, infrastructure, specialty (healthcare, data centers, education). Project mix often predicts technology fit better than revenue.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic footprint.</strong> Local, regional, multi-state, national. Geographic concentration affects project management complexity and technology requirements.</li>

          <li><strong>Trade specialty.</strong> For subcontractors: electrical, mechanical, plumbing, concrete, steel, drywall. Each trade has unique workflow and technology needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> Project management software, estimating tools, accounting system, BIM capabilities. Integration complexity varies dramatically by existing stack.</li>

          <li><strong>Backlog and growth trajectory.</strong> Healthy backlog, flat, declining. Contractors at different growth stages have different buying urgency and budget availability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your construction market, current segmentation approach, and the questions you're trying to answer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions, looking for patterns that predict success. Project types, geographic coverage, and company type are central to the analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to prioritize, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring adjustments, and resource allocation changes.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What construction data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your construction sales data to identify your ideal customer profile, segment accounts by project types and geographic regions, predict churn, and find patterns in win/loss data. The output is actionable recommendations for targeting general contractors, subcontractors, and developers.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze performance differences between commercial and residential contractors?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We frequently help companies understand whether their ICP skews toward commercial general contractors, residential builders, specialty subcontractors, or developers. Each segment has fundamentally different project economics, technology adoption patterns, and buying processes.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle project type and geographic region analysis?</h3>
          <p>We segment contractors by their primary project types (commercial, residential, industrial, infrastructure) and geographic footprint. Regional concentration, project mix, and backlog health often predict technology adoption and deal velocity better than revenue alone.</p>

          <h3>What if our data is messy?</h3>
          <p>Most construction sales data is. Contractor names have multiple DBAs, project types aren't consistently categorized, and geographic coverage is often unknown. We can clean and enrich your data before analysis.</p>
