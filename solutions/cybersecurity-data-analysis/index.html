        <h2>The Cybersecurity Sales Analysis Problem</h2>

        <p>Cybersecurity is a crowded market. Thousands of vendors compete for security budget. Most deals require displacing an incumbent. Understanding where you win—and why—is critical for focusing limited sales resources.</p>

        <p>Basic segmentation by company size or industry misses what actually predicts success. Security maturity, existing tool stack, compliance requirements, and threat landscape all influence buying behavior.</p>

        <h3>Security maturity trumps company size</h3>
        <p>A 500-person company with a dedicated CISO and mature security program buys differently than a 5,000-person company where IT handles security part-time. Maturity often predicts success better than headcount.</p>

        <h3>Competitive dynamics are complex</h3>
        <p>You might consistently beat one competitor but lose to another. Understanding competitive patterns—who you displace successfully, who you lose to, and why—shapes positioning and qualification.</p>

        <h3>Compliance drives many purchases</h3>
        <p>SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP. Compliance requirements create urgency but also constrain decisions. Understanding how compliance context affects your win rate helps prioritize the right opportunities.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What Cybersecurity Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <h3>ICP by Security Maturity</h3>
        <p>Which security maturity levels have the highest win rates? Where do you provide the most value? We segment beyond company size to find your true ICP.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Companies with 2-5 person security teams have 3x higher win rates than those with 10+ person teams. You're strongest with growing security programs, not mature ones."</p>

        <h3>Competitive Win/Loss Patterns</h3>
        <p>Which competitors do you consistently beat? Which do you lose to? We analyze competitive dynamics to inform positioning and qualification.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "You win 70% against Vendor A but only 20% against Vendor B. When Vendor B is incumbent, disqualify early. When Vendor A is present, lean into the competition."</p>

        <h3>Compliance-Driven Buying Analysis</h3>
        <p>How do compliance requirements affect sales outcomes? Which frameworks create urgency that converts to wins?</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "SOC 2-driven deals close 40% faster than general security improvements. Compliance urgency is a stronger signal than stated pain."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Platform Patterns</h3>
        <p>Which customers expand to additional modules? What predicts platform adoption vs. point solution usage?</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers who integrate with SIEM in first 60 days have 200% higher expansion rates. Integration is the leading indicator of platform success."</p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Security maturity level.</strong> Dedicated CISO, security team size, existing tool sophistication. Maturity often predicts success better than size.</li>

          <li><strong>Existing security stack.</strong> What tools do they already use? Stack composition predicts integration success and competitive dynamics.</li>

          <li><strong>Compliance requirements.</strong> SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP, GDPR. Compliance context creates urgency and shapes requirements.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry vertical.</strong> Financial services, healthcare, technology, manufacturing. Each has different threat profiles and buying patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Incident history.</strong> Companies that have experienced breaches buy differently than those that haven't. Recent incidents create urgency.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitive landscape.</strong> Who are you replacing? Who else is in the deal? Competitive patterns predict outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What cybersecurity data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your cybersecurity sales data to identify ideal customer profiles by security maturity, industry vertical, and company size. We find patterns in win/loss data, competitive displacement, and expansion that help focus your go-to-market efforts.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze competitive displacement patterns?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Cybersecurity deals often involve replacing incumbent solutions. We analyze which competitors you successfully displace, which you lose to, and what factors predict competitive wins.</p>

          <h3>How do you analyze security maturity as a segmentation factor?</h3>
          <p>Security maturity—whether a company has a dedicated CISO, security team size, existing tool stack—often predicts buying behavior better than company size. We analyze how maturity correlates with win rates, deal size, and sales cycle length.</p>
