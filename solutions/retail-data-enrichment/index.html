        <h2>The Retail Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to retailers. Products, technology, services, or solutions for retail operations. Your CRM has company names and maybe a corporate contact. That's not enough to run an effective sales motion.</p>

        <p>Retail buyer data is hard to find. Merchandising and buying teams are protected from vendors. Corporate offices screen calls. Store-level contacts are scattered. Your SDRs spend hours researching each retailer before they can start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>Buyers are hard to reach</h3>
        <p>Retail buyers get pitched constantly. They don't list direct contact information. Corporate switchboards don't connect you. Without verified direct contact data, you're not breaking through to the people who make purchasing decisions.</p>

        <h3>Store footprint is unclear</h3>
        <p>How many stores do they have? Where are they located? Are they expanding or contracting? Store count and format data determines deal size and fit, but it's not in your CRM.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack is hidden</h3>
        <p>What POS system do they use? What e-commerce platform? If you're selling retail technology, knowing their current stack is essential for qualification and competitive positioning. But retailers don't advertise their infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>Expansion signals are invisible</h3>
        <p>Which retailers are opening new stores? Who just raised capital? Which chains are investing in new categories? Growth signals indicate opportunity, but they're not in your CRM.</p>

        <h2>What Retail Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach actual buyers.</strong> With verified merchandising and buying contacts, you're reaching the people who can place orders instead of getting lost in corporate gatekeeping.</li>
          <li><strong>Size opportunities accurately.</strong> Store count and format data helps you understand deal potential and position pricing appropriately.</li>
          <li><strong>Target by technology.</strong> Retailers on legacy systems get modernization pitches. Those on competitor platforms get migration messaging. Tech data enables relevance.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize growing chains.</strong> Expansion signals help you focus on retailers that are actively investing and have budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Understand complex organizations.</strong> Retail chains have corporate, regional, and store-level decision-makers. Understanding the structure helps you engage at the right level.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Retailer names, formats, categories you're targeting. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Buyer contacts? Store data? Tech stack? Growth signals? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched prospects immediately.</p>
