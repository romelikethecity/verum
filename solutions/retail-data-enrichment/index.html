        <h2>The Retail Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's line review season. Your sales team is scheduling meetings with retail buyers across your key accounts. The relationships you've spent years building. The placements that drive the majority of your revenue.</p>

        <p>Except the buyer at your biggest account switched categories. The category manager at chain #2 left for a competitor. The VP of Merchandising at chain #3 retired and you're back to square one with their replacement. Your carefully maintained buyer relationships are suddenly full of question marks.</p>

        <p>Retail moves fast. Your data isn't keeping up.</p>

        <h3>Retail turnover is extraordinary</h3>
        <p>Retail has some of the highest turnover rates of any industry. At the buyer and category manager level, people move between retailers, switch categories, get promoted, or leave the industry entirely. The buyer you pitched last season might not be in that seat today.</p>

        <h3>Category assignments change without notice</h3>
        <p>Retailers reorganize. Categories get combined or split. The buyer who handled your product line might now be responsible for something completely different. The new buyer handling your category might not know who you are.</p>

        <h3>Corporate versus store contacts create complexity</h3>
        <p>Selling to retail often means managing relationships at multiple levels. Corporate buyers, regional merchandisers, store-level managers. Each level has different data quality challenges. A contact database that mixes all of them creates chaos.</p>

        <h3>Retail consolidation reshapes your market</h3>
        <p>Retailers merge. Chains get acquired. Stores close. The retail landscape shifts constantly, and your account data doesn't automatically reflect those changes. You might be pitching accounts that no longer exist in their original form.</p>

        <p>Every email to someone who changed roles is a relationship at risk. Every pitch to the wrong category buyer is a meeting that won't happen. Every account you don't know was acquired is a sale that might slip away. In a competitive CPG landscape, you can't afford to be working from last year's org charts.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Retail Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a research team to know who the current buyer is. Verum takes your retail buyer databases, account lists, and CRM exports, and makes them current. We verify contacts, track role changes, and enrich account data. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating titles, and verifying current employers. We catch the turnover before your team pitches to empty seats.</p>
        <p><strong>For retail teams:</strong> Know when your buyer moves to a new retailer. Stop pitching to people who changed categories.</p>

        <h3>Buyer Intelligence Enrichment</h3>
        <p>We append category assignments, reporting structures, and organizational data where available. Know who handles what before you reach out.</p>
        <p><strong>For retail teams:</strong> Pitch the right buyer the first time. Understand the merchandising hierarchy.</p>

        <h3>Account Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Store counts, revenue estimates, recent news. We enrich your account data with the firmographic information that helps you prioritize and personalize.</p>
        <p><strong>For retail teams:</strong> Know which retailers are expanding versus contracting. Focus on accounts with growth potential.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But retail data has quirks. Buyers with multiple category responsibilities. Regional versus national roles. Every file gets human review before delivery.</p>

        <h2>What Retail Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Prepare for line reviews efficiently.</strong> When your buyer data is current, you're not scrambling to figure out who handles your category. Walk into meetings with accurate relationship intelligence.</li>

          <li><strong>Track buyers across retailers.</strong> When a good buyer moves to a new chain, that's a relationship you want to maintain. Clean data lets you follow people, not just accounts.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce time researching org charts.</strong> Your sales team shouldn't spend hours figuring out who the current buyer is. Get verified contact data and focus on selling.</li>

          <li><strong>Prioritize accounts by opportunity.</strong> Enriched data helps you focus on retailers with growth potential, active category reviews, or expansion plans.</li>

          <li><strong>Maintain relationships through turnover.</strong> When your contact leaves and a replacement arrives, clean data helps you identify and connect with the new decision-maker quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your systems, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? Custom CRM? Spreadsheets? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Retail buyer data changes constantly. We can run quarterly refreshes before major selling seasons. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Retail Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any system.</p>

          <h3>Can you help us identify the right buyer for our category?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We enrich retailer records with buyer contact information, category assignments where available, and organizational data. Know who handles your product category before you pitch.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with both grocery and mass retail?</h3>
          <p>We work across retail channels. Grocery, mass, drug, convenience, club, specialty. If they're buying products, we can help you reach them.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of retail relationships and that data is stale? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before line review season, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. Your retail relationships are competitive intelligence.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with emerging brands and established CPG companies. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of distribution scale.</p>
