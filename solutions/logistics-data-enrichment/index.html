        <h2>The Logistics Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling logistics services, freight technology, or building carrier capacity. Your CRM has company names and maybe a main number. That's not enough to win shipper accounts or recruit quality carriers.</p>

        <p>Logistics contact data is challenging. Shippers protect their logistics teams from cold calls. Carrier contacts change frequently. Facility locations matter for lane development. Your sales team spends hours researching each prospect before they can start outreach.</p>

        <h3>Logistics contacts are hidden</h3>
        <p>Traffic managers and supply chain directors don't list direct phone numbers. Carrier dispatchers use personal cells that aren't public. Without verified contact data, you're not reaching the decision-makers who control freight.</p>

        <h3>Freight volume is unclear</h3>
        <p>Which companies ship significant volume? You can't always tell from basic firmographics. A manufacturer with multiple DCs has different needs than a single-location operation. You need signals about freight intensity.</p>

        <h3>Facility locations are incomplete</h3>
        <p>For lane development, you need to know where shippers have facilities. Origin and destination data drives your capacity planning. But facility-level data isn't in your CRM.</p>

        <h3>Carrier capacity is hard to assess</h3>
        <p>For brokerages and shippers building carrier networks, fleet size, equipment types, and lane experience matter. But this data requires research across multiple sources.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the data that logistics sales and operations teams need to identify, qualify, and engage shippers and carriers effectively.</p>

        <h3>Decision-maker contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for logistics decision-makers. Supply chain directors, traffic managers, logistics coordinators, fleet managers, dispatch leads. The people who control freight decisions and carrier selection.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for target contacts.</p>

        <h3>Company firmographics</h3>
        <p>Revenue, employee count, industry, and company structure. For shippers, understanding company size helps you qualify opportunities and position your services appropriately.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firmographic profiles for logistics prospects.</p>

        <h3>Facility and location data</h3>
        <p>Manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, warehouse locations. Geographic data is essential for lane development and understanding shipper network patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Location data enabling lane-based prospecting and capacity planning.</p>

        <h3>Carrier profile data</h3>
        <p>Fleet size, equipment types, operating authority, safety ratings, and lane history where available. For brokerages and shippers, understanding carrier capabilities helps with network development.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Carrier profile data enabling capacity qualification and network building.</p>

        <h3>Growth signals</h3>
        <p>New facility announcements, expansion plans, hiring activity, and M&A signals. Companies adding locations or growing operations typically need more freight capacity.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Growth signals enabling timely outreach to expanding shippers.</p>
