        <h2>The Logistics Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's peak season. You need capacity for a major customer. Your TMS shows 50 carriers who've hauled this lane before. Good rates. Proven performance. Should be straightforward.</p>

        <p>First dispatcher's number goes straight to voicemail. Message never returned. Second carrier's MC number shows revoked authority. Third one went out of business three months ago. Fourth one's dispatcher quit and nobody updated your system. You're scrambling to find capacity while your customer waits.</p>

        <p>Freight doesn't wait for your database to catch up.</p>

        <h3>Driver turnover ripples through everything</h3>
        <p>The trucking industry has turnover rates above 90%. When drivers leave, dispatch staff often follow. That dispatcher you built a relationship with? There's a good chance they're at a different carrier now. Or out of the industry entirely. Your contact data ages faster in logistics than almost any other sector.</p>

        <h3>Small carriers appear and disappear constantly</h3>
        <p>The trucking industry has over 900,000 carriers. Most are small. Many are fragile. Thousands of trucking companies fail or cease operations every year. Others get acquired or merge. Your carrier database is accumulating dead entries faster than you realize.</p>

        <h3>Insurance and authority status changes without notice</h3>
        <p>A carrier's insurance lapses. Their authority gets revoked. FMCSA status changes. None of this automatically updates in your TMS. You find out when you're trying to tender a load and discover you can't use a carrier you were counting on.</p>

        <h3>Shipper contact decay hurts sales too</h3>
        <p>It's not just carriers. If you're selling freight services, your shipper contacts decay just as fast. Transportation managers change roles. Companies restructure their supply chains. The logistics buyer you knew might be gone before your next renewal conversation.</p>

        <p>Every disconnected number is a load that almost didn't move. Every dead carrier is capacity you can't use. Every outdated shipper contact is revenue walking out the door. Your competitors with clean data are covering loads while you're leaving messages that won't get returned.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Logistics Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a full-time admin just to know which carriers are still operating. Verum takes your carrier databases, shipper lists, and TMS exports, and makes them current. We verify contacts, check carrier status, and enrich records. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating phone numbers, and verifying email addresses. We catch the turnover before you're scrambling for capacity.</p>
        <p><strong>For logistics teams:</strong> Stop calling dispatchers who left six months ago. Know when your contacts move to new carriers.</p>

        <h3>Carrier Verification</h3>
        <p>Is that trucking company still in business? Has their authority been revoked? We cross-reference against FMCSA data and other sources to flag carriers that need attention before you try to tender loads.</p>
        <p><strong>For logistics teams:</strong> Remove inactive carriers from your database. Know which carriers are still operating before you need them.</p>

        <h3>Capacity Intelligence Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing fleet size? Equipment types? Lanes served? We fill in the gaps so your carrier sourcing actually works. Know which carriers handle which freight before you start calling.</p>
        <p><strong>For logistics teams:</strong> Match the right carriers to the right loads. Stop asking flatbed carriers about van freight.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But logistics data has quirks. Owner-operators with multiple MC numbers. Carriers operating under different names. Every file gets human review before delivery.</p>

        <h2>What Logistics Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Find capacity faster.</strong> When you need trucks, you need them now. Clean carrier data means less time calling dead numbers and more time covering loads.</li>

          <li><strong>Track carrier relationships across turnover.</strong> When a good dispatcher moves to a new carrier, that's a new capacity relationship. Clean data lets you follow the people, not just the companies.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce compliance headaches.</strong> Flag carriers with authority or insurance issues before they become your problem. Better data means fewer surprises at load tender.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve shipper outreach.</strong> If you're selling freight services, clean shipper data means your sales team actually reaches transportation decision-makers.</li>

          <li><strong>Build a carrier network that reflects reality.</strong> Know which carriers in your database are actually operating, have capacity, and can be reached. Stop inflating your carrier count with dead entries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your systems, data sources, and specific challenges. McLeod? TMW? Custom TMS? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Logistics data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep pace with industry turnover. Or clean up before peak seasons. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Logistics Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. No IT project required.</p>

          <h3>Can you verify carrier authority and insurance?</h3>
          <p>We can flag carrier compliance data for verification and cross-reference against FMCSA databases. We don't replace your compliance process, but we can identify which carriers need attention and which appear to have current credentials.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with TMS exports?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We've worked with exports from McLeod, TMW, Aljex, Turvo, and most major TMS platforms. If your system can export data, we can clean it. We'll return it in whatever format you need.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new shipper prospects, that's their strength. But if you already have years of carrier and shipper relationships and now that data is stale? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. Your carrier network is competitive intelligence. We treat it that way.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with independent brokers and large 3PLs. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of load volume. A carrier database with 200 contacts has the same decay issues as one with 20,000.</p>
