        <h2>The Healthcare Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's Wednesday morning. Your medical device rep is driving to a hospital for what should be an easy upsell. She checked Salesforce before leaving. Dr. Martinez, the orthopedic surgeon who loved your last demo, is her contact.</p>

        <p>She gets to the hospital. Dr. Martinez left eight months ago. Moved to a competing health system across town. The new surgeon hasn't heard of your company. The visit is wasted. The drive was wasted. And somewhere in your CRM, Dr. Martinez's old record is still marked as "active."</p>

        <p>This happens more in healthcare than any other industry. The data just moves faster.</p>

        <h3>Provider data decays at terrifying speed</h3>
        <p>Almost one-third of physicians change affiliations and practice locations every year. A former COO of a national health plan estimated that 6 to 8 percent of their network provider information was changing monthly. Your CRM can't keep up. Nobody's can, without active maintenance.</p>

        <h3>The NPI registry is a mess</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="https://curatus.com/npi-registry-15-years-later-has-provider-data-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curatus research</a>, only 8.2% of the 6.2 million NPIs in the NPPES database have been updated within the past year. More than half haven't been touched in over five years. By law, providers are supposed to update within 30 days of any change. In practice, they don't. That NPI you're relying on for credentialing or claims? There's a good chance the address is wrong.</p>

        <h3>Directory accuracy is worse than you think</h3>
        <p>A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11256460/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study published in PMC</a> found that all specialties had less than 50% consistency of physician addresses and phone numbers across health insurer directories. Not some specialties. All of them. Your internal data probably isn't much better.</p>

        <h3>Specialty matters, and not in a good way</h3>
        <p>Primary care physicians and high-referral specialties like dermatology tend to have better data consistency. But anesthesiologists, radiologists, emergency medicine docs? Their data is all over the place because they rarely get direct patient referrals. If you're selling to hospitals or health systems, you need all of them accurate.</p>

        <p>The cost of this chaos shows up everywhere. Wasted sales visits. Denied claims from incorrect NPI data. Marketing campaigns sent to physicians who left years ago. Credentialing delays because the addresses don't match. And your team spending hours every week trying to verify what should already be clean.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Healthcare Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a dedicated data analyst just to trust your provider records. Verum takes the decaying, inconsistent, NPI-mismatched data across your systems and makes it usable. We cross-reference multiple sources, flag the problems, and fix them. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>NPI Verification and Enrichment</h3>
        <p>We match your provider records against the NPPES registry, flag mismatches, and append missing NPI numbers. But we go further. We identify records that haven't been updated in the registry for years and cross-reference against other sources to find current information.</p>
        <p><strong>For healthcare teams:</strong> Stop credentialing delays from NPI mismatches. Catch the providers who moved before your next campaign goes out.</p>

        <h3>Provider Contact Refresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your HCP contacts against multiple data sources, identifying job changes, new affiliations, updated practice addresses, and current phone numbers. We catch the 33% annual turnover before it catches you.</p>
        <p><strong>For healthcare teams:</strong> Your reps stop showing up to hospitals where their contacts left. Your emails stop bouncing. Your credentialing packets go to the right address.</p>

        <h3>Affiliation and Network Mapping</h3>
        <p>Physicians don't exist in isolation. They have hospital privileges, group practice memberships, health system affiliations. We map these relationships so you understand not just who the provider is, but where they actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For healthcare teams:</strong> Know when a key physician moves from an independent practice to a major health system. Spot consolidation before your competitors do.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But healthcare data is too important to trust entirely to algorithms. Every file gets human review before it goes back to you. We catch the edge cases that automated systems miss.</p>

        <h2>What Healthcare Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Eliminate wasted sales visits.</strong> Reps know before they drive that Dr. Martinez moved to St. Luke's three months ago. They call ahead, confirm the meeting, or redirect to the new contact.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce claims denials from NPI errors.</strong> When the NPI on file actually matches the provider's current practice address, claims go through. Less back-and-forth with payers. Faster reimbursement.</li>

          <li><strong>Speed up credentialing.</strong> Provider applications don't get kicked back because the address doesn't match or the NPI is outdated. Days saved on every new provider.</li>

          <li><strong>Target the right physicians for product launches.</strong> Know which orthopedic surgeons are at which hospitals, which health systems are growing, and which decision-makers actually have authority.</li>

          <li><strong>Track provider movement across your territory.</strong> When a high-value physician moves health systems, you know within days. Not months later when a rep finally hears about it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data. We'll show you where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce Health Cloud? Veeva? Custom CRM? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Healthcare data decays faster than most industries. We can run monthly or quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Healthcare Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Do you handle HIPAA compliance?</h3>
          <p>We don't touch PHI. We work with provider data, HCP contact information, and organizational records. No patient data, no protected health information. That said, we're happy to sign BAAs if your compliance team requires it for working with any healthcare data.</p>

          <h3>Can you match against the NPI registry?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We cross-reference your provider records against NPPES data, flag mismatches, and append missing NPI numbers. We also catch the records that haven't been updated in the registry for years and cross-reference against other sources to find current information.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new HCP names for cold outreach, that's their strength. But if you already have thousands of provider contacts from years of sales activity, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have. We enrich specific data points you're missing.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year depending on seats and features. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh in six months? Pay for that refresh. No ongoing fees eating your budget while you're not actively using it.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> This is the one most people don't realize until it's too late. ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete all their data if you terminate your contract. Every contact, every enrichment field, gone. You never actually own what you paid for. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours. Forever. Cancel anytime, keep everything.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand healthcare data sensitivity. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific security requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with organizations from 10-person medical device startups to Fortune 500 pharma companies. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount.</p>
