        <h2>The Healthcare Data Gap Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to healthcare organizations. You know your target accounts. But your CRM has a hospital name and maybe a general phone number. That's not enough to run a real sales motion.</p>

        <p>Healthcare buying committees are complex. The CIO cares about integration. The CMIO cares about clinical workflow. The CFO cares about ROI. You need to reach all of them, and you need accurate contact data to do it. Most teams are working with incomplete records that force reps to spend hours hunting for the right person.</p>

        <h3>Contact data is sparse</h3>
        <p>Hospital websites list a main phone number and maybe an executive team page with no contact details. LinkedIn shows who works there but not how to reach them. Your SDRs are spending half their time researching instead of selling.</p>

        <h3>Organizational data is incomplete</h3>
        <p>Is that hospital part of a health system? How many beds? What EHR are they running? These details matter for targeting and personalization, but they're scattered across dozens of sources that nobody has time to compile manually.</p>

        <h3>Provider data changes constantly</h3>
        <p>Physicians move between organizations. Administrators get promoted or leave. Health systems acquire new facilities. The contact you found last quarter might not be there anymore, and new decision-makers have appeared that you don't know about.</p>

        <h3>NPI data needs context</h3>
        <p>You might have NPI numbers, but do you have the associated contact data? NPI tells you someone is a licensed provider, but it doesn't give you their current email, their organization's bed count, or whether they're the right person to talk to about your solution.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See What's Missing From Your Data</a>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We don't just append whatever data we can find. We enrich with the specific fields that healthcare sales and marketing teams actually need, verified for accuracy.</p>

        <h3>Contact information</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails, direct phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles. We don't give you a general hospital line and call it done. We find the actual contact data for the specific people you need to reach.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Deliverable email addresses with 93% accuracy guarantee, direct dials where available, and LinkedIn URLs for social selling.</p>

        <h3>NPI and provider data</h3>
        <p>NPI numbers verified against NPPES, specialty classifications, license status. For physician contacts, we ensure the NPI matches the individual and confirm they're still active and at the organization you think they're at.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Verified NPI numbers, specialty codes, and confirmation of current organizational affiliation.</p>

        <h3>Organization firmographics</h3>
        <p>Bed count, facility type (acute care, ambulatory, post-acute), health system affiliation, geographic coverage. The details that let you segment accounts and personalize outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete organizational profiles including size, type, ownership structure, and system relationships.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack</h3>
        <p>What EHR are they running? Epic, Cerner, Meditech, something else? For healthcare IT sales, this is often the first qualification question. We identify the platforms in use so you can prioritize accounts with compatible technology.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> EHR/EMR platform identification plus other healthcare IT systems where detectable.</p>

        <h3>Decision-maker mapping</h3>
        <p>Who are the actual buyers? We identify titles and individuals involved in purchasing decisions: CIOs, CMIOs, CFOs, department heads, clinical leadership. Not just who works there, but who makes decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Mapped buying committees with contact data for each stakeholder.</p>

        <h2>What Healthcare Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run targeted campaigns.</strong> Segment by facility type, bed count, EHR platform, or health system. Send the right message to the right accounts instead of generic blasts.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable multi-threaded outreach.</strong> With contact data for multiple stakeholders at each account, your reps can engage the full buying committee instead of depending on a single champion.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize by fit.</strong> Use firmographic data to score accounts. Focus on organizations that match your ICP instead of working a list alphabetically.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize at scale.</strong> Mention their EHR platform, reference their health system's recent news, acknowledge their facility type. Enriched data makes personalization possible without manual research.</li>
          <li><strong>Track provider movement.</strong> When enrichment becomes ongoing, you catch job changes and organizational moves. Your champion who left? We'll find where they went.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Account names, existing contacts, whatever you have. We'll work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or plain spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Which fields matter most? What titles are you targeting? Any specific requirements for your use case?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify emails, and run human QA on flagged records. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields appended, plus a summary of match rates and data quality metrics.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What healthcare data can you enrich?</h3>
          <p>We enrich healthcare B2B contact data with verified emails, direct phone numbers, NPI numbers, organizational details (bed count, health system affiliation, facility type), EHR/EMR platform, and decision-maker titles. We pull from 50+ sources including NPPES, professional associations, and proprietary databases.</p>

          <h3>How accurate is your healthcare contact data?</h3>
          <p>We guarantee 93% email deliverability on enriched contacts. Every record goes through automated verification plus human QA. For healthcare specifically, we cross-reference NPI data, organizational affiliations, and multiple sources to ensure accuracy. If a contact doesn't meet our accuracy threshold, we don't include it.</p>

          <h3>Can you find contacts at specific hospitals or health systems?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Give us a list of target organizations and the titles you need, and we'll find verified contacts. We can identify decision-makers across health systems, individual hospitals, ambulatory centers, and physician practices. Common requests include CIOs, CMIOs, CFOs, department heads, and clinical leadership.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three differences: (1) We enrich your existing data rather than selling net-new contacts, so you're not starting from scratch. (2) Pricing is per-project, not $15K-50K annually. (3) You own the data forever with no deletion requirements. We're a service that fixes your data, not a subscription database.</p>

          <h3>What if you can't find data for some records?</h3>
          <p>We're transparent about match rates. If we can't verify contact data for a record, we'll tell you rather than guessing. Typical enrichment rates for healthcare are 70-85% depending on the data you start with and fields requested. We'll give you expected match rates before you commit.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Fill the Gaps in Your Healthcare Data?</h2>

        <p><strong>Not sure what you're missing?</strong> Send us a sample list. We'll analyze it free and show you what we can enrich.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to enrich?</strong> Most healthcare projects start same-day. You'll have enriched data back in 24-48 hours.</p>
