        <h2>The AI & ML Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's pipeline review. Your sales team is working through a list of "AI-ready" companies. The ones who should be buying your ML infrastructure, your data platform, your AI development tools.</p>

        <p>First company on the list has an "AI strategy" that turns out to be a chatbot on their website. Second one posted ML engineering jobs six months ago but never hired. Third one's VP of Data Science left for a competitor. The "Head of AI" at prospect number four? His LinkedIn says he's now at a startup in a completely different space.</p>

        <p>When everyone claims to be doing AI, finding the real buyers is harder than ever.</p>

        <h3>The AI hype makes targeting nearly impossible</h3>
        <p>Surveys show over 70% of companies claim some form of AI initiative. But the gap between "we're exploring AI" and "we have budget to buy AI tools" is enormous. Your sales team wastes hours chasing companies that added AI to their press releases but have no real technical infrastructure or budget.</p>

        <h3>Technical buyer titles are inconsistent and changing</h3>
        <p>Head of AI. VP of Machine Learning. Chief Data Officer. Director of Data Science. ML Platform Lead. The titles for your buyers vary wildly across companies. And these roles are new enough that people move between them constantly. The data science leader you identified six months ago might have already jumped to another company.</p>

        <h3>Funding and growth signals matter more in AI</h3>
        <p>AI initiatives require investment. Companies without recent funding or strong revenue growth rarely have budget for new AI infrastructure. But your CRM doesn't automatically track when a prospect just raised a Series B or when their competitor shipped something that puts pressure on them to catch up.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack signals are hard to find and verify</h3>
        <p>You want to sell to companies using specific frameworks, cloud platforms, or data infrastructure. But that information is scattered across job postings, GitHub repos, and conference talks. By the time you've researched one prospect's stack, you've burned an hour.</p>

        <p>Selling AI tools to companies that aren't actually building AI is a waste of everyone's time. Your pipeline needs to be full of companies with real initiatives, real budgets, and real technical buyers who are still in their seats.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves AI & ML Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a research team to figure out which prospects are actually building AI. Verum takes your prospect lists and enriches them with the signals that matter. We verify contacts, add firmographics, and help you identify the companies worth pursuing. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating titles, and verifying current employers. We catch the 30% annual decay before it fills your pipeline with ghosts.</p>
        <p><strong>For AI/ML companies:</strong> Know that the VP of Data Science you're targeting is still at that company. Stop emailing people who left months ago.</p>

        <h3>Technical Buyer Identification</h3>
        <p>We normalize the chaos of AI/ML titles so your segmentation works. Head of AI, VP ML, Chief Data Officer - we map them to your buyer personas and fill in the gaps in your coverage.</p>
        <p><strong>For AI/ML companies:</strong> Find the technical decision-makers even when their titles don't match your keyword searches.</p>

        <h3>Company Intelligence Enrichment</h3>
        <p>We add funding history, employee growth, technology signals, and other indicators that help you prioritize. Know which companies have the budget and momentum to actually buy.</p>
        <p><strong>For AI/ML companies:</strong> Focus on companies that just raised funding or are hiring ML engineers. Skip the ones that are all talk.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. The AI/ML space moves fast. Automated systems miss context that humans catch.</p>

        <h2>What AI & ML Companies Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Build pipeline with companies that actually buy.</strong> When you can identify real AI initiatives versus marketing buzzwords, your conversion rates improve. Your sales team stops wasting time on unqualified prospects.</li>

          <li><strong>Track technical buyer movement.</strong> When your champion moves to a new company, that's a warm lead. Clean data lets you follow data science leaders as they change roles.</li>

          <li><strong>Prioritize by funding and growth signals.</strong> Focus on companies that just raised capital or are actively hiring ML talent. Those are the ones with budget and urgency.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by tech stack compatibility.</strong> Know which prospects are already using complementary technologies. Lead with relevant integration stories instead of generic pitches.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce research time for SDRs.</strong> When contact data is verified and enriched, your team can focus on outreach instead of LinkedIn stalking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? HubSpot? Outreach? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        The AI/ML space moves fast. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep your data current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Why AI & ML Leaders Choose Verum</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>We do the work.</strong> This isn't another platform to learn. Send us your data, get clean data back. Your team stays focused on selling.</li>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Clean your data before the next board meeting, not after pipeline review goes badly.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Every project gets both.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Project-based pricing fits startup budgets.</li>

          <li><strong>We understand the AI landscape.</strong> The difference between a data scientist and an ML engineer. MLOps versus data engineering. Why a company using PyTorch matters differently than one on TensorFlow. We know the domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About AI & ML Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify companies with actual AI initiatives vs. buzzwords?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We look at job postings (are they hiring ML engineers?), tech stack signals, funding announcements, and other indicators. A company with three data scientists and a recent Series B is different from one that added "AI-powered" to their homepage.</p>

          <h3>What buyer titles can you identify?</h3>
          <p>We map the full spectrum: VP of Data Science, Head of AI/ML, Chief Data Officer, ML Platform Lead, Director of Engineering (ML), and dozens of variations. We normalize them to your buyer personas so segmentation works.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of leads and now that data is stale? That's us. We clean and enrich what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before a funding push, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We understand that your prospect list is competitive intelligence.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with seed-stage AI startups and established ML platform companies. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of scale.</p>
