        <h2>The AI/ML Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to AI/ML teams. Startups building models, enterprises scaling ML, companies adopting AI for the first time. Your CRM has company names and maybe some product signup data. That's not enough to compete in the crowded AI infrastructure market.</p>

        <p>AI/ML buyer data has unique challenges. ML engineers are technical and hard to reach through sales channels. Team structures vary wildly. The signals that indicate ML investment, like compute spend and model deployment velocity, aren't publicly available. Your SDRs spend hours researching each account before they can start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>ML teams are hard to reach</h3>
        <p>ML engineers and data scientists don't respond to generic sales emails. They're skeptical of vendors. Their contact information is protected. Without verified direct contact data and technical credibility, you're not getting through to evaluation.</p>

        <h3>Team structures vary wildly</h3>
        <p>Some companies have a VP of ML. Some have ML engineers embedded in product teams. Some have a centralized platform team. You need to understand how ML is organized at each target to identify the right contacts and approach.</p>

        <h3>Funding doesn't tell the whole story</h3>
        <p>An AI startup that raised Series B might be spending it all on compute or might be cutting back. You need signals beyond funding: hiring velocity, team growth, infrastructure expansion. These indicate actual ML investment and buying potential.</p>

        <h3>Infrastructure matters for positioning</h3>
        <p>If you're selling ML tools, knowing their current stack is essential. Are they on AWS or GCP? Using SageMaker or Databricks? Running on Kubernetes? This context determines fit and competitive positioning.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that AI/ML sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage companies building and deploying machine learning.</p>

        <h3>ML team contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for ML practitioners and leaders. Heads of AI, ML platform leads, senior ML engineers, data science managers, and MLOps engineers. The people who evaluate and buy ML infrastructure.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for ML team contacts.</p>

        <h3>Technical buying committee</h3>
        <p>We identify both the ML practitioners who evaluate tools and the executives who approve budget. Engineering leadership, platform teams, and finance stakeholders for larger purchases.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multi-contact enrichment showing the technical and business stakeholders.</p>

        <h3>ML infrastructure stack</h3>
        <p>Cloud providers, ML platforms, experiment tracking, feature stores, model serving, data infrastructure. We identify what technologies companies are using for ML so you can qualify fit and position effectively.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data showing current ML infrastructure across key categories.</p>

        <h3>AI investment signals</h3>
        <p>Beyond funding, we track ML-specific signals: ML team hiring velocity, GPU-related job postings, ML engineer growth rates, and AI-focused news mentions. These indicate active ML investment.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> AI investment signals for qualification and prioritization.</p>

        <h3>Funding and growth data</h3>
        <p>Recent funding rounds, investors, valuation signals, and overall company growth trajectory. Combined with ML-specific signals, this gives you a complete picture of AI investment potential.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Funding history and growth signals for target AI/ML companies.</p>

        <h2>What AI/ML Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach ML practitioners directly.</strong> With verified contact info for ML team members, you connect with evaluators instead of getting lost in corporate gatekeepers.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize by ML investment.</strong> AI investment signals help you focus on companies actively scaling their ML capabilities and likely to have budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Position against current stack.</strong> "I see you're on SageMaker" opens a different conversation than generic outreach. Infrastructure data enables relevant positioning.</li>
          <li><strong>Time outreach to growth.</strong> Companies rapidly hiring ML engineers need tools to support that growth. Hiring signals help you reach out when there's urgency.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread across technical and business.</strong> With both ML practitioners and executives identified, your reps can engage the full buying committee.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Company names, domains, whatever AI/ML companies you're targeting. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> ML team contacts? Full buying committee? Infrastructure stack? Investment signals? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What AI/ML buyer data can you enrich?</h3>
          <p>We enrich contact records with verified work emails, direct phone numbers, job titles, and LinkedIn profiles. For AI/ML sales, we focus on ML engineers, data scientists, ML platform leads, heads of AI, and technical executives.</p>

          <h3>Can you provide AI/ML infrastructure data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We identify what ML infrastructure companies are using: cloud providers, ML platforms, experiment tracking tools, feature stores, and model serving frameworks.</p>

          <h3>Do you have funding data for AI startups?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We enrich with funding history, recent rounds, investors, and valuation data. We also track AI-specific signals like ML team hiring velocity and compute-related job postings.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from using Crunchbase or PitchBook?</h3>
          <p>Those tools show company funding but not direct contact information for ML teams. We provide verified emails and direct dials for ML practitioners and leaders. We also enrich your existing CRM data directly.</p>

          <h3>What about early-stage AI startups?</h3>
          <p>Coverage varies by stage. For Series A+ AI companies, we typically achieve 80%+ enrichment rates. For seed-stage startups, rates are 60-75%. We'll give you expected rates before you commit.</p>
