        <h2>The Professional Services Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Consulting firms, accounting practices, advisory businesses. Your CRM is built on relationships. But over years of engagements, partner transitions, and organic growth, that relationship data has become a mess.</p>

        <p>Professional services has unique data challenges. Every partner brings their own network. Clients get added under different names by different people. Contacts move frequently at senior levels. And the same executive might be in your system from five different conferences and three different partners' outreach efforts.</p>

        <h3>Client names are inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"Acme Corp" and "Acme Corporation" and "ACME Inc" and "Acme Holdings" might be the same client. Or different entities. When partners can't see the full relationship history, they reach out not knowing a colleague already has a relationship there. That's embarrassing and damaging.</p>

        <h3>Contact data is fragmented</h3>
        <p>Partner A met the CFO at a conference. Partner B worked with them on a project three years ago. Partner C has them in a personal contact list. Now you have three records with different information, and nobody knows the complete relationship history.</p>

        <h3>Executives move constantly</h3>
        <p>The C-suite contacts that matter most for professional services are also the most mobile. The CFO you worked with moved to a different company. The CIO retired. The VP you knew got promoted. Every job change creates stale data and missed opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Company hierarchies are complex</h3>
        <p>You did work for a division, but the parent company is the real relationship. Or vice versa. Subsidiaries, divisions, holding companies. Without clean hierarchy data, you can't see the full picture of client relationships.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See What's Wrong With Your Client Data</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Professional Services Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the relationship-driven nature of professional services data. Client hierarchies that need to be captured correctly. Contact attribution that matters for partner credit. Engagement history that shouldn't be lost in deduplication.</p>

        <h3>Client deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match client records across names, domains, and identifier patterns. We understand that "Microsoft" and "MSFT" and "Microsoft Corporation" are the same client, while "Microsoft Services" might be a different billing entity you need to track separately.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Unified client records with complete engagement history, plus a merge log showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Contact consolidation</h3>
        <p>We dedupe contacts across partner networks and touchpoints, creating single records with full relationship attribution. You'll know who has the relationship and the complete history of interactions.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per contact with all relationship data preserved.</p>

        <h3>Email and phone validation</h3>
        <p>We verify contact information for current validity. Executive contacts are especially prone to changes. We flag stale data and validate current contact methods.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with job change flags on stale contacts.</p>

        <h3>Company hierarchy mapping</h3>
        <p>We standardize company structures so you can see relationships at the parent level while maintaining detail at the subsidiary or division level. Roll-up reporting actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Clean company hierarchies enabling accurate client relationship views.</p>

        <h2>What Professional Services Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>See complete client relationships.</strong> When duplicates are merged, partners can see the full firm relationship before reaching out. No more embarrassing collisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Coordinate partner outreach.</strong> Clean contact data with proper attribution means partners know who else in the firm has a relationship.</li>
          <li><strong>Run targeted business development.</strong> Accurate company and contact data enables effective ABM and targeted outreach campaigns.</li>
          <li><strong>Track alumni and job changes.</strong> Cleaned data shows when contacts have moved, creating opportunities to reach out at their new companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust pipeline reporting.</strong> When client data is clean, revenue forecasting and pipeline metrics actually mean something.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull client and contact data from your CRM or PSA system. We work with exports from Salesforce, Dynamics, Deltek, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, stale contacts, company hierarchy issues, and data fragmentation. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, hierarchy mapping. Human review on complex client relationships. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle client company duplicates?</h3>
          <p>We match client records across company names, domains, and contact patterns. Consulting firms often have the same client listed under different names, divisions, or subsidiaries. We consolidate these while preserving engagement history.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean contact data from multiple partners' networks?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We dedupe across partner sources, identifying when the same contact appears multiple times from different partners. The result is one clean record per contact with full relationship attribution preserved.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with PSA and CRM system exports?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. We regularly clean data exported from Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, HubSpot, Deltek, and other PSA platforms. We understand the data structures and can work with your existing export formats.</p>

          <h3>How long does professional services data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Complex deduplication across multiple partner contact lists may take 3-5 business days. We'll give you a timeline after reviewing your export.</p>

          <h3>What about engagement and project history?</h3>
          <p>We preserve engagement history during deduplication. When we merge client or contact records, we maintain the full history of interactions and projects so nothing is lost.</p>
