        <h2>The Martech Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell marketing automation, analytics, content tools, or advertising technology. Your CRM is full of marketers across thousands of companies. But marketing leadership changes constantly.</p>

        <p>That CMO you've been nurturing? Left for another company six months ago. The VP of Marketing who showed interest? Her startup got acquired and role was eliminated. The Head of Demand Gen on your target list? Promoted and now has a different title with different priorities. Your database reflects a marketing landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Martech sales data has unique challenges. Short CMO tenures, constantly evolving marketing titles, and the way companies restructure marketing functions mean your prospect data goes stale fast.</p>

        <h3>Marketing leaders change jobs constantly</h3>
        <p>CMO tenure averages around 2.5 years—the shortest in the C-suite. VPs of Marketing, Heads of Growth, and demand gen leaders move even more frequently. That contact list from last year? A significant portion has already moved on.</p>

        <h3>Marketing titles are wildly inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"CMO," "Chief Growth Officer," "VP Marketing," "Head of Growth," "VP Demand Generation"—all potentially similar roles with different responsibilities at different companies. Your segmentation breaks when the same buyer persona appears under dozens of different titles.</p>

        <h3>Marketing teams restructure constantly</h3>
        <p>Growth teams spin up and dissolve. Demand gen merges with sales ops. Content marketing gets absorbed into product marketing. The "VP of Digital Marketing" becomes "VP of Growth" or reports to a newly created "Chief Revenue Officer." Your data doesn't keep up.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought marketing leader databases, CMO lists, demand gen contact data. Each list has different title conventions, different ages, different accuracy levels. Now you have the same person five times with different titles and companies.</p>

        <p>Clean data is your competitive advantage in martech. While others send emails to people who left months ago, you could be building relationships with actual decision-makers.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See How Clean Data Transforms Martech Sales</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Martech Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy marketing leader database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation and Job Change Detection</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. When marketing leaders move, we flag the outdated records so you can update your outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>For martech sales teams:</strong> Stop nurturing dead contacts. Know when CMOs move before your competitors do. Reach decision-makers at their current companies.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when titles differ or data came from different lists. We merge intelligently, keeping the most recent and complete information from each record.</p>
        <p><strong>For martech sales teams:</strong> One clean record per contact. No more embarrassing duplicate outreach. Clear ownership in your CRM.</p>

        <h3>Title Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize marketing titles so "CMO," "Chief Growth Officer," and "VP Marketing" are consistently categorized. Your segmentation by seniority and function actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>For martech sales teams:</strong> Target by role accurately. Build reliable lists of C-level marketing vs. VP-level vs. director-level. Messaging that matches the audience.</p>

        <h3>Email Validation</h3>
        <p>We check every email against multiple validation sources. Invalid addresses, role-based emails, and known bounces get flagged before they hurt your sender reputation.</p>
        <p><strong>For martech sales teams:</strong> Higher deliverability rates. Fewer bounces. Outbound that actually reaches inboxes.</p>

        <h2>What Martech Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach actual decision-makers.</strong> When contacts are validated and job changes detected, your outreach hits real marketing leaders at real companies. Not former employees, not bounced emails.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by seniority accurately.</strong> Standardized titles let you target CMOs differently from VPs, directors differently from managers. Messages resonate because they match the audience level.</li>

          <li><strong>Track where marketers go.</strong> When decision-makers move companies, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people change employers.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> When duplicates are removed and contacts validated, your pipeline numbers reflect reality. Forecasting works when data is clean.</li>

          <li><strong>Protect your sender reputation.</strong> Every bounced email hurts deliverability. Clean email lists mean higher inbox placement rates for all your outbound.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        Send us a sample export. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Marketing leaders move frequently. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Martech Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of martech data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Marketing leader databases, CMO contact lists, demand generation contacts, marketing operations data, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach marketing decision-makers.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle the variety of marketing titles?</h3>
          <p>We standardize marketing titles across variations. CMO, Chief Growth Officer, VP Marketing, Head of Growth all get normalized into consistent categories so your segmentation and targeting work correctly.</p>

          <h3>What CRMs and tools do you work with?</h3>
          <p>Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Apollo, and any system that can export data. If you can get it into a CSV or spreadsheet, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>Can you help identify when contacts change jobs?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We cross-reference contacts against current employment data and flag records where the person appears to have moved. This is especially valuable in marketing where turnover is high.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our data?</h3>
          <p>Given the turnover rate in marketing leadership, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after purchasing new lists.</p>
