        <h2>The MarTech Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Marketing generates leads from everywhere: content downloads, webinars, events, paid campaigns, organic forms. Every touchpoint creates data. And without rigorous data management, that data becomes a liability.</p>

        <p>MarTech companies face unique challenges. You're collecting high volumes of leads constantly. Every campaign adds more records. Forms are optimized for conversion, not data quality. And the same person engages with multiple pieces of content, creating duplicates that break your attribution and inflate your metrics. (For inbound leads specifically, see <a href="/cleaning/lead-data-cleaning/">lead data cleaning</a>.)</p>

        <h3>Duplicates everywhere</h3>
        <p>Someone downloads an ebook, then registers for a webinar, then fills out a demo form. That's three records for one person, each with different information. Your lead scoring doesn't work. Your nurture campaigns email them multiple times. Your attribution is completely broken.</p>

        <h3>Missing company data</h3>
        <p>Marketing forms collect whatever people type. "Google" and "Alphabet Inc" and "google.com" all refer to the same company. Or they leave the field blank entirely. You can't segment by company size or industry when half your records have no usable firmographic data.</p>

        <h3>Email quality degrades fast</h3>
        <p>Marketing databases have the highest bounce rates because leads come from low-friction forms. People use fake emails, typo their addresses, or leave companies after engaging. Every bounced email hurts your sender reputation and campaign performance.</p>

        <h3>Personal emails hide enterprise buyers</h3>
        <p>Enterprise decision-makers often engage with content using personal emails to avoid sales calls. Your database has gmail.com addresses that might be CMOs at Fortune 500 companies. Without enrichment, you can't identify these high-value leads.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans MarTech Data</h2>

        <p>We understand marketing data. High volume, multiple touchpoints, complex attribution requirements. We clean your data while preserving the engagement history and attribution you need.</p>

        <h3>Lead deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match leads across emails, company domains, and name variations. We consolidate records from all your marketing touchpoints into single golden records with complete engagement history preserved.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One clean record per lead with full engagement and attribution history.</p>

        <h3>Company data standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names and fill in missing firmographic data. "google" becomes "Google LLC" with industry, employee count, and revenue data attached. Your segmentation actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized company data enabling accurate segmentation and scoring.</p>

        <h3>Email validation</h3>
        <p>We verify every email for deliverability before it goes into your campaigns. We catch typos, fake addresses, and emails that have become invalid. Your bounce rate drops and your sender reputation improves.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails.</p>

        <h3>Personal email enrichment</h3>
        <p>For leads with personal emails, we identify their work email and company when possible. Your hidden enterprise leads become identifiable and actionable.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Work emails and company attribution for high-value leads.</p>

        <h2>What Marketing Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Fix attribution models.</strong> When duplicates are merged, attribution accurately reflects the customer journey instead of counting the same person multiple times.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve email deliverability.</strong> Validated emails mean fewer bounces, better sender reputation, and higher campaign performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable real segmentation.</strong> Clean company data means your segments by size, industry, and firmographics actually work.</li>
          <li><strong>Find hidden enterprise leads.</strong> Personal email enrichment reveals high-value leads you didn't know you had.</li>
          <li><strong>Run coordinated nurtures.</strong> One record per person means coordinated, relevant nurture campaigns instead of conflicting messages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull leads from your MAP, CRM, or CDP. We work with exports from Marketo, HubSpot, Salesforce, Segment, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, missing company data, email validity, and personal email percentages. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization, enrichment. Attribution preserved throughout. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your marketing operations team gets clean data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle marketing automation duplicates?</h3>
          <p>We dedupe across all marketing touchpoints: form submissions, webinar registrations, content downloads, event leads, and third-party lists. We consolidate into single records while preserving full engagement history and attribution data.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean data across multiple marketing systems?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We consolidate and dedupe across systems, creating unified records ready to import back into your primary platform. We handle Marketo, HubSpot, Salesforce, Segment, and other common systems.</p>

          <h3>Will cleaning affect my attribution data?</h3>
          <p>We preserve attribution and engagement history during deduplication. When we merge duplicate leads, we maintain all touchpoint data so your attribution models continue to work.</p>

          <h3>How long does martech data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most marketing database cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Large databases with complex multi-system deduplication may take 3-5 business days.</p>

          <h3>What about leads from purchased lists?</h3>
          <p>Purchased list data often has the worst quality. We validate and clean this data, deduping against your organic leads, so you're not paying for contacts you already have.</p>
        </div>
