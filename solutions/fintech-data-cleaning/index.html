        <h2>The Fintech Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell technology or services to financial institutions. Your CRM contains banks, credit unions, fintech startups, and wealth managers. But the financial services industry never stops consolidating.</p>

        <p>That community bank you've been nurturing? Acquired by a regional last quarter. The credit union executive you built a relationship with? Moved to a different institution. The fintech startup on your target list? Ran out of runway and shut down. Your database reflects a financial services landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Financial services data has unique challenges. Constant M&A, regulatory changes, and executive turnover mean your prospect data ages faster than most industries.</p>

        <h3>Bank and credit union consolidation never stops</h3>
        <p>Hundreds of financial institutions merge every year. Community banks get acquired by regionals. Credit unions merge for scale. Your target account list includes institutions that no longer exist as independent entities. Contacts move, titles change, and decision-making authority shifts to new headquarters.</p>

        <h3>Fintech startup data is volatile</h3>
        <p>Fintech companies raise funding, pivot, get acquired, or shut down constantly. That hot payments startup from your last prospecting push? Might be part of a bigger company now—or might not exist at all. Your data doesn't reflect the current reality.</p>

        <h3>Financial services executives move frequently</h3>
        <p>CIOs, CTOs, and digital transformation leaders are in high demand across financial services. They move between institutions regularly. The executive you've been nurturing might be three banks removed from where your CRM says they are.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought bank contact lists, credit union databases, fintech company data. Each list has different formats, different ages, different levels of accuracy. Now you have the same institution five times with conflicting information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for financial services sales. Long sales cycles and complex buying committees mean you can't afford to waste months pursuing institutions that merged or contacts who moved.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Fintech Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy financial services database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Institution Validation and M&A Tracking</h3>
        <p>We verify that financial institutions still exist as independent entities, flag those that have been acquired or merged, and update records where we can identify successor institutions.</p>
        <p><strong>For fintech sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing banks that no longer exist. Know when targets have merged. Focus on institutions that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when institution names vary or data came from different sources. We handle parent-subsidiary relationships and branch vs. headquarters distinctions.</p>
        <p><strong>For fintech sales teams:</strong> One clean record per institution. Clear understanding of corporate hierarchies. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the institutions you think they are. Executive moves get flagged so you can update relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>For fintech sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current institutions. Know when executives move. Maintain relationships across job changes.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize institution names, types (bank, credit union, fintech), asset sizes, and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For fintech sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by institution type and size. Target community banks vs. regionals accurately. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Fintech Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on active institutions.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on banks that merged or fintechs that shut down. Every account in your database represents a real institution that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track executive moves.</strong> When decision-makers move between institutions, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people change employers within financial services.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate complex hierarchies.</strong> Understand holding company structures. Know which contacts belong to which entities. Avoid confusion between branches and headquarters.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by institution type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target community banks differently from regionals, credit unions differently from fintechs. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your financial institution database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Financial services M&A never stops. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Fintech Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of fintech data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Financial institution databases, bank and credit union contacts, fintech startup lists, investor relations contacts, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the financial services industry.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle sensitive data?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, secure processing environment, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We work with business contact data for sales purposes, not customer financial data or transaction records.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you track bank mergers and acquisitions?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate institution names against current regulatory data and can flag records where banks have merged or been acquired. This is especially valuable given the pace of financial services consolidation.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our financial services data?</h3>
          <p>Given the pace of M&A, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant consolidation activity in your target segments.</p>
