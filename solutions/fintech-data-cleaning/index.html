        <h2>The Fintech Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to banks, insurance companies, wealth managers, payment processors. Financial services institutions with compliance requirements and long sales cycles. The data in your CRM needs to be accurate because your prospects take accuracy seriously.</p>

        <p>But financial services data is notoriously messy. M&A activity constantly changes ownership and names. Job turnover in banking creates stale contacts. Regional variations and subsidiaries make company matching a nightmare. And duplicates from trade shows, purchased lists, and inbound leads pile up fast.</p>

        <h3>Company names are chaos</h3>
        <p>"Bank of America" and "BofA" and "BOFA" and "Bank of America Corporation" are all the same company in your CRM. Or are they different subsidiaries? When you're selling to regulated institutions, getting the legal entity right matters. Your ABM campaigns fail when you can't even count how many contacts you have at each bank.</p>

        <h3>M&A scrambles everything</h3>
        <p>Regional banks get acquired. Payment companies merge. Fintech startups get bought by big players. The contacts you had at First Republic are now at JPMorgan. Maybe. Your CRM doesn't know, and neither do your reps until they reach out and get confused responses.</p>

        <h3>Job changes in financial services</h3>
        <p>Banking executives move frequently, especially at VP and director levels. Compliance officers rotate. Technology leaders get poached by fintechs. Every job change creates a stale record in your CRM and a potential compliance issue if you're still sending to their old work email.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates create compliance risk</h3>
        <p>When the same contact exists multiple times with different information, which record is correct? In financial services, where KYC and accurate record-keeping matter, duplicates aren't just an annoyance. They create audit issues and confuse your own compliance processes.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Fintech Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the specific challenges of financial services data. Legal entity names that need to match regulatory databases. Subsidiary structures that need to be captured correctly. Contact data that needs to be current and accurate.</p>

        <h3>Legal entity standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names to official registered entities. "Goldman" becomes "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc." or the appropriate subsidiary. We understand holding company structures and can map contacts to the correct legal entities in complex organizational hierarchies.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized company names that match regulatory databases and enable accurate account-level reporting.</p>

        <h3>M&A-aware deduplication</h3>
        <p>We track major financial services mergers and acquisitions. Contacts at acquired institutions get flagged. Company records get updated to reflect current ownership. You stop reaching out to people at banks that no longer exist.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Deduplicated contacts with acquisition status noted, so you know when to update your approach.</p>

        <h3>Email validation for financial domains</h3>
        <p>Financial institutions have strict email security. Catch-all domains, complex routing, and aggressive spam filtering. We verify emails against these challenges and flag addresses that might look valid but won't actually deliver.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with financial institution-specific validation.</p>

        <h3>Regulatory-friendly formatting</h3>
        <p>Addresses standardized to USPS format. Phone numbers in consistent international format. Company names matching SEC and FINRA registered entities where applicable. The formatting your compliance team expects.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Clean, standardized data ready for compliance review and regulatory reporting.</p>

        <h2>What Fintech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run compliant outreach.</strong> When your data is accurate and standardized, your compliance team isn't asking why you're emailing people who left the company or contacting the wrong legal entity.</li>
          <li><strong>Execute ABM against banks.</strong> Clean company data means you can actually count contacts at each institution and run coordinated campaigns across the buying committee.</li>
          <li><strong>Prepare for partnerships.</strong> When a bank wants to see your customer list or verify your data practices, clean data makes due diligence smoother.</li>
          <li><strong>Support KYC processes.</strong> Sales data that matches your KYC records. No more discrepancies between what sales says and what compliance has on file.</li>
          <li><strong>Merge CRMs after acquisition.</strong> Fintech M&A is constant. Clean data before merging systems prevents the mess of trying to dedupe after the fact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contacts, leads, and accounts from your CRM. We work with standard exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, or other systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, entity issues, email validity, and fintech-specific problems. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, entity standardization, email validation, format normalization. Human review on anything that needs judgment. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of changes. Your CRM now has data your compliance team can trust.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

          <h3>How does data cleaning help with KYC compliance?</h3>
          <p>Clean data is essential for KYC. Duplicates create confusion about who you're actually doing business with. Inconsistent company names make it harder to verify entities.

          <h3>Do you work with regulated financial data?</h3>
          <p>We clean B2B sales and marketing data, not consumer financial records or transaction data. This includes prospect lists, CRM contacts, partner databases, and business account information. We don't process PII subject to GLBA or consumer financial data.</p>

          <h3>Can you standardize company legal names?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We normalize company names to official registered entities where possible. "JPM" becomes "JPMorgan Chase & Co.", variations like "Goldman" and "Goldman Sachs" get standardized.

          <h3>How long does fintech data cleaning take?</h3>

          <h3>What about data from acquired companies?</h3>
          <p>Post-acquisition data cleanup is one of our most common fintech projects. We dedupe across both databases, standardize company names, validate emails, and identify records that need updates due to the acquisition. The result is one clean database ready to import.</p>
