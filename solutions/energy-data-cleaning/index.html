        <h2>The Energy Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>The energy sector is complex. Utilities with regulated holding structures. Oil & gas with constantly changing asset ownership. Renewable energy with startups growing, pivoting, and getting acquired at high rates. Your CRM reflects all that complexity, often in messy ways.</p>

        <p>Energy has unique data challenges. Utility names vary between holding company and operating company. Oil & gas companies merge and divest assets constantly. Renewable energy developers become operators or get acquired. Contacts move between companies or shift to different parts of the value chain. Without clean data, you're working blind.</p>

        <h3>Utility hierarchies are confusing</h3>
        <p>"Duke Energy" and "Duke Energy Carolinas" and "Duke Energy Progress" might all be in your CRM. Are they the same account? Different operating utilities? Your account counts don't make sense and ABM campaigns hit the same utility multiple times.</p>

        <h3>M&A activity is constant</h3>
        <p>Energy has some of the highest M&A activity of any industry. Oil & gas companies merge. Utilities acquire each other. Renewable developers get bought by infrastructure funds. Your database has contacts at companies that no longer exist under those names.</p>

        <h3>Renewables changes fast</h3>
        <p>The solar developer you added last year might be an IPP now. Or got acquired. Or pivoted to storage. The renewable energy landscape changes faster than traditional energy, and your database ages quickly.</p>

        <h3>Asset vs company confusion</h3>
        <p>In oil & gas, the same asset might change hands while the operating company name stays similar. You have contacts at "Basin Permian Operations" without knowing who actually owns the asset now. Company and asset data gets mixed up.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Energy Data</h2>

        <p>We understand energy sector structure. Utility holding companies and operating subsidiaries. Oil & gas operators and service companies. Renewable developers, IPPs, and equipment manufacturers.</p>

        <h3>Utility hierarchy standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize utility names and map proper hierarchies. All Duke Energy operating utilities connect to the holding company correctly. You can segment and report at any level of the hierarchy.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized utility names with holding company relationships mapped.</p>

        <h3>M&A-aware deduplication</h3>
        <p>We track energy sector mergers and acquisitions. Records at acquired companies get flagged. Company names get updated where appropriate. You stop reaching out to people at companies that no longer exist.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Deduplicated contacts with acquisition status noted.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that contacts are still at the companies you expect. Energy sector restructuring creates stale data. We flag contacts who've moved and validate email deliverability.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails with job change flags.</p>

        <h3>Segment classification</h3>
        <p>We classify energy companies by segment: utilities, oil & gas (upstream, midstream, downstream), renewable developers, IPPs, and energy technology. Clean segmentation enables targeted campaigns.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent segment classification for targeting and reporting.</p>

        <h2>What Energy Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run utility ABM effectively.</strong> When utility hierarchies are mapped, you can coordinate campaigns across operating utilities or target at the holding company level.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop chasing outdated companies.</strong> M&A tracking means you're not pursuing contacts at companies that no longer exist under those names.</li>
          <li><strong>Segment by energy type.</strong> Clean classification lets you run targeted campaigns to utilities vs oil & gas vs renewables.</li>
          <li><strong>Track industry movement.</strong> Job change tracking shows you where your contacts have landed after restructuring.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline metrics.</strong> When companies are properly attributed, your revenue reporting by segment actually makes sense.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contacts and accounts from your CRM. We work with exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, hierarchy issues, M&A impacts, and segment classification. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, hierarchy mapping, M&A updates, validation. Human review on complex utility relationships. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle utility holding company structures?</h3>

          <p>Renewable companies change rapidly. We track growth, pivots, and acquisitions, flagging records accordingly. We also handle the distinction between developers, operators, and manufacturers.</p>

          <h3>How long does energy data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most energy sector CRM cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Complex hierarchy mapping may take 3-5 business days.</p>
