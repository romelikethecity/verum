        <h2>The Energy Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell technology, equipment, or services to energy companies. Your CRM contains utilities, oil & gas producers, renewable developers, and energy service firms. But the industry never stops restructuring.</p>

        <p>That midstream company you've been pursuing? Acquired last quarter. The utility executive you built a relationship with? Reorganized into a different division. The oil & gas producer on your target list? Merged with a competitor and the contacts all changed. Your database reflects an energy industry that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Energy sector data is uniquely challenging. Constant M&A, regulatory changes, and market shifts mean your prospect data ages faster than most industries.</p>

        <h3>M&A activity scrambles your accounts</h3>
        <p>Energy sees massive consolidation. Oil companies merge. Utilities acquire each other. Renewable developers get bought by majors. Your target account list becomes a graveyard of company names that no longer exist independently. Contacts move, titles change, and organizational structures shift overnight.</p>

        <h3>Industry restructuring is constant</h3>
        <p>Energy companies reorganize constantly—spinning off divisions, creating new business units, shifting from traditional to renewable focus. The drilling division becomes a standalone company. The utility splits into regulated and unregulated entities. Your CRM can't keep up.</p>

        <h3>Contacts move within the industry</h3>
        <p>Energy professionals tend to stay in energy, but they move between companies frequently. The VP at one producer becomes a director at another. The utility manager joins an ESCO. Your contacts are still in the industry—just not where your database says they are.</p>

        <h3>Company naming is inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"ExxonMobil," "Exxon Mobil," "Exxon," and "XOM" might all be in your CRM. Multiply that across hundreds of energy companies with multiple subsidiaries each. Duplicates and inconsistent naming make segmentation and reporting unreliable.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for energy sales. Long sales cycles and complex buying committees mean you can't afford to waste months pursuing companies that merged or contacts who moved.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Energy Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy energy sector database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company Validation and M&A Tracking</h3>
        <p>We verify that companies still exist as independent entities, flag those that have been acquired or merged, and update records where we can identify successor companies.</p>
        <p><strong>For energy sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing companies that no longer exist. Know when targets have been acquired. Focus on accounts that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across Subsidiaries</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names vary or data came from different sources. We handle parent-subsidiary relationships so you don't have the same company entered fifteen different ways.</p>
        <p><strong>For energy sales teams:</strong> Clean account hierarchies. Clear understanding of company relationships. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Industry moves get flagged so you can update relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>For energy sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current companies. Know when contacts move. Maintain relationships even as people change roles.</p>

        <h3>Industry Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, segment classifications (upstream, midstream, downstream, utility, renewable), and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and reporting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For energy sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by subsector. Target upstream vs. utility accurately. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Energy Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on live opportunities.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on companies that merged or were acquired. Every account in your database represents a real entity that can actually buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track relationship moves.</strong> When contacts move between energy companies, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people change employers within the industry.</li>

          <li><strong>Build accurate account hierarchies.</strong> Understand parent-subsidiary relationships. Know which contacts belong to which entities. Navigate complex corporate structures.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by subsector accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target upstream operators differently from utilities, renewables differently from midstream. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline and forecasts.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of what cleaning can realistically accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your data sources and target segments. Oil & gas? Utilities? Renewables? We've worked with all types of energy sector data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your energy company database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Energy M&A never stops. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current with industry changes. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Energy Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of energy data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Oil and gas company databases, utility contacts, renewable energy prospect lists, energy service company data, midstream operators, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the energy sector.</p>

          <h3>Can you help track M&A activity?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate company names against current business registries and can flag records where companies appear to have been acquired or merged. This is especially valuable in energy where consolidation is constant.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle complex corporate structures?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Energy companies often have complex parent-subsidiary relationships. We can help standardize and clarify these relationships in your data.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our energy data?</h3>
          <p>Given the pace of M&A in energy, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant industry consolidation activity.</p>
