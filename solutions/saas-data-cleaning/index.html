        <h2>The SaaS CRM Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You've invested in Salesforce, HubSpot, or whatever CRM your team swears by. You've got marketing automation, intent data tools, maybe a conversation intelligence platform. The tech stack is solid. But the data running through it? That's another story.</p>

        <p>SaaS companies generate massive volumes of contact data. Inbound leads, event attendees, content downloads, product signups, trial users. Every touchpoint creates records. And without constant maintenance, those records decay, duplicate, and corrupt faster than anyone has time to fix manually.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates are everywhere</h3>
        <p>Marketing imports a webinar list without deduping. Sales adds contacts from a conference. Product creates records for trial signups. Customer success has their own tracking. Now you've got four records for the same person, each with different information, and nobody knows which one to trust. Your SDR calls someone who already talked to an AE. Your marketing emails go out three times to the same inbox.</p>

        <h3>Email deliverability is tanking</h3>
        <p>People change jobs. Companies get acquired. Email addresses that worked six months ago now bounce. Your sender reputation suffers. Open rates drop. Eventually, Gmail starts putting you in spam. You're not just wasting sends on dead addresses. You're hurting your ability to reach the valid ones.</p>

        <h3>Company data is a mess</h3>
        <p>"Salesforce" and "Salesforce.com" and "salesforce" and "SFDC" are all the same company in your CRM. Good luck running an ABM campaign when you can't even count how many contacts you have at each account. Lead routing breaks. Reporting is unreliable. Territory assignments don't work.</p>

        <h3>Old data is clogging the system</h3>
        <p>Records from 2019 that haven't been touched since. Leads from campaigns that ended years ago. Contacts at companies that no longer exist. You're paying for CRM seats to store garbage and it's slowing down every report, search, and workflow.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans SaaS Data</h2>

        <p>We don't plug into your CRM and run automated rules. We take your data, clean it properly with human verification, and give it back ready to import. The process is simple. The results are thorough.</p>

        <h3>Smart deduplication</h3>
        <p>We don't just match on email address. We use fuzzy matching on names, company associations, phone patterns, and behavioral signals to catch duplicates that simple rules miss. John Smith at Acme and J. Smith at Acme Inc are probably the same person. We figure that out.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> A single golden record for each contact with the most complete, most recent information. Plus a merge log showing exactly what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Email validation</h3>
        <p>Every email gets verified for deliverability. Not just format checks, actual verification that the mailbox exists and will accept mail. We flag catch-all domains, identify role-based addresses, and score confidence levels so you know which emails to trust.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Validated emails with deliverability scores, bounced addresses flagged for removal, and risky addresses identified for manual review.</p>

        <h3>Company standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names so "Salesforce", "salesforce.com", and "SFDC" become one consistent entry. We standardize industries, employee counts, and other firmographic fields so your segmentation and routing actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent company data across all records with standardized fields ready for your workflows.</p>

        <h3>Data enrichment where needed</h3>
        <p>Cleaning often reveals gaps. Missing titles, outdated company info, incomplete records. We can enrich as part of the cleaning process so you get complete records back, not just cleaner versions of incomplete ones.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Option to fill gaps discovered during cleaning with verified enrichment data.</p>

        <h2>What SaaS Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Improve email deliverability.</strong> When bounces drop and engagement rises, your sender reputation recovers. Marketing emails actually reach inboxes again.</li>
          <li><strong>Make ABM work.</strong> Accurate company data means your account-based campaigns hit the right accounts with the right contacts. No more guessing how many people you actually have at target accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Fix lead routing.</strong> Clean company names and standardized fields mean leads route correctly. No more leads falling through cracks or going to wrong reps.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your reporting.</strong> When duplicates are gone and data is standardized, your pipeline metrics, win rates, and campaign attribution finally mean something.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce CRM costs.</strong> Removing dead records and duplicates can cut your contact count significantly. Fewer contacts means lower CRM costs and faster system performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contacts, leads, and accounts from Salesforce, HubSpot, or wherever. We work with standard exports, no special formatting required.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> Before we quote, we analyze what you sent. Duplicate rate, email validity, data completeness, key issues. We'll tell you what we find, even if you decide not to proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on anything that needs judgment calls. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> We give you an import-ready file plus documentation of what changed. You import to your CRM with confidence that the data is right.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle Salesforce data cleaning?</h3>
          <p>We work directly with Salesforce exports. You export your contacts, leads, or accounts as CSV, we clean them, and you import the cleaned file back. We handle deduplication across objects, email validation, company standardization, and field normalization. No Salesforce admin access needed.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean HubSpot data too?</h3>
          <p>Yes. HubSpot exports work the same way. We also handle the specific quirks of HubSpot data like company-contact associations, lifecycle stage cleanup, and removing contacts that have bounced or unsubscribed but weren't properly marked.</p>

          <h3>What's your duplicate detection rate?</h3>
          <p>We typically find 10-20% duplicates in SaaS CRMs, sometimes higher after acquisitions or major list imports. Our matching goes beyond exact email matches to catch variants like john@company.com and j.smith@company.com that belong to the same person.</p>

          <h3>How long does SaaS data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most SaaS CRM cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 100,000 records. Larger databases or complex multi-object deduplication may take 3-5 business days. We'll give you a timeline after reviewing your export.</p>

          <h3>What if we have multiple CRMs to merge?</h3>
          <p>That's actually one of our most common projects. Post-acquisition CRM merges, switching from HubSpot to Salesforce, consolidating regional databases. We clean and dedupe across all sources before you import to the destination system.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Clean Your SaaS CRM?</h2>

        <p><strong>Not sure how bad it is?</strong> Export 5,000 records and send them over. We'll analyze free and show you exactly what needs fixing.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to fix it?</strong> We can usually start same-day. Most SaaS teams get clean data back within 48 hours.</p>
