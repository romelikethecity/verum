        <h2>The Legal Market Targeting Challenge</h2>

        <p>The legal market is notoriously difficult to segment. Am Law 100 firms, regional powerhouses, boutique specialists, solo practitioners. General counsel at Fortune 500s, legal ops at mid-market companies, in-house teams at startups. They all need legal technology and services, but they buy very differently.</p>

        <p>Most legal tech companies segment by firm size or attorney count. These broad categories miss what actually predicts buying behavior. A 50-attorney litigation boutique operates nothing like a 50-attorney general practice firm. Practice area and firm culture often matter more than headcount.</p>

        <p>Which practice areas close fastest? Do Am Law 200 firms expand better than Am Law 100? Where does your solution actually get budget? Your deal history contains the patterns.</p>

        <h3>Partnership politics slow everything</h3>
        <p>Law firm decisions often require partner consensus. A champion in one practice group can't force adoption across the firm. Understanding which firm structures and sizes allow faster decisions is crucial for forecasting and resource allocation.</p>

        <h3>Practice areas are different businesses</h3>
        <p>Litigation, corporate, IP, real estate, labor and employment. Each practice area has different workflows, billing models, client demands, and technology needs. A solution that resonates with litigators might fall flat with corporate attorneys.</p>

        <h3>The Am Law rankings matter, but not how you think</h3>
        <p>Am Law 100 firms have budget but brutal procurement processes. Am Law 200 firms balance scale and agility. Mid-size firms make faster decisions with smaller deals. Boutiques vary wildly. Understanding where your sweet spot lies changes everything.</p>

        <h2>What Legal Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not vanity metrics. Insights that change how you target and sell.</p>

        <h3>ICP by Firm Type and Practice Area</h3>
        <p>Which law firm types are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion, and churn across segments.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Litigation-focused Am Law 200 firms close at 3x the rate of Am Law 100 corporate practices. Smaller initial deals but 40% faster cycles and 2x expansion rates."</p>

        <h3>Win/Loss by Firm Tier</h3>
        <p>How do Am Law rankings correlate with your success? We analyze win rates, cycle times, and deal sizes across firm tiers to find your optimal target profile.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Am Law 101&#8209;200 firms have the best LTV/effort ratio. Am Law 50 deals close 50% of the time but take 14 months. Regional firms close in 4 months at 65% rates."</p>

        <h3>Practice Area Performance</h3>
        <p>Different practice areas within the same firm have different technology budgets and adoption patterns. We identify which specializations drive your results.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "IP and litigation practices expand 2x more than corporate. But corporate deals have 30% lower churn. Prioritize IP for growth, corporate for stability."</p>

        <h3>Geographic and Market Position Analysis</h3>
        <p>Regional markets, New York-centric vs. distributed, single-office vs. multi-office. We analyze how firm footprint affects buying behavior.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Texas and Florida regional firms close at 2x the rate of comparable Northeast firms. Less competitive pressure and shorter procurement cycles."</p>

        <h2>Legal-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Firm tier and ranking.</strong> Am Law 100, Am Law 200, NLJ 500, regional, boutique, solo. Each tier has different budget processes and decision timelines.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice area concentration.</strong> Litigation, corporate/M&A, IP, real estate, labor, regulatory. The dominant practice often predicts technology needs and buying behavior.</li>

          <li><strong>Attorney count and structure.</strong> Total attorneys, partner count, associate ratio, of counsel. Structure affects both budget and decision complexity.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic footprint.</strong> Single office, regional network, national, international. Office structure affects procurement and rollout complexity.</li>

          <li><strong>Client industry focus.</strong> Financial services, healthcare, tech, general practice. Firms serving specific industries may have unique needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology maturity.</strong> Early adopters vs. traditional firms. Legal tech adoption patterns vary dramatically by firm culture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your legal market focus, current segmentation approach, and the questions you need answered.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We assess what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions. Firm tier and practice area interactions are often the most revealing cuts in legal.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which firm types to prioritize, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help translate findings into targeting criteria, account scoring, and territory planning adjustments.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What legal industry data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your sales data to identify which law firm types, practice areas, and firm sizes correlate with success. Output includes ICP recommendations, win/loss patterns by Am Law tier, and resource allocation guidance for selling to law firms and legal departments.</p>

          <h3>How do you segment law firms for analysis?</h3>
          <p>We analyze by practice area (litigation, corporate, IP, real estate), firm size (Am Law 100, Am Law 200, mid-size, boutique), attorney count, geographic footprint, and client industry focus. These dimensions reveal very different buying patterns.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze practice area performance separately?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Different practice areas within law firms have distinct technology needs and budgets. Litigation teams buy differently than corporate groups. We identify which practice areas drive your best outcomes and what triggers their buying decisions.</p>

          <h3>What about corporate legal departments?</h3>
          <p>We analyze in-house legal teams by company size, industry, legal team headcount, and outside counsel spend. The dynamics differ from law firms but the pattern-finding approach is the same.</p>
