        <h2>The HR Tech Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>Every company has employees. Every company needs HR tools. Your addressable market seems unlimited. But "has employees" isn't an ICP.</p>

        <p>HR technology buying is driven by thresholds. Compliance kicks in at 50 employees. Benefits complexity increases at 100. Enterprise needs emerge around 1,000. But these thresholds interact with HR team maturity, industry, and existing tech stack in ways that aren't obvious.</p>

        <p>The company at 200 employees with a VP of People Operations buys very differently than the 500-employee company where the office manager handles HR. Employee count matters, but it's not the whole story.</p>

        <h3>Employee count thresholds drive behavior</h3>
        <p>At 50 employees, ACA reporting kicks in. At 100, different compliance requirements apply. Enterprise features matter at 1,000+. Your wins cluster around specific employee bands. Understanding which bands and why reveals your true ICP.</p>

        <h3>HR maturity determines buying process</h3>
        <p>Administrative HR runs on spreadsheets and buys reactive solutions to immediate problems. Strategic People Operations plans technology roadmaps and buys proactive platforms. Same employee count, completely different buying motion.</p>

        <h3>HRIS ecosystem creates lock-in and opportunity</h3>
        <p>Companies on Workday have different point solution needs than those on BambooHR. HRIS platforms create ecosystems that enable some integrations and block others. Your data reveals which ecosystems you win in.</p>

        <h2>What HR Tech Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not vanity metrics. Recommendations that change your targeting and close rates.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Employee Band</h3>
        <p>Which employee count ranges are your sweet spot? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across employee bands to identify where you have product-market fit.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Companies with 200-500 employees have 3x higher LTV than companies with 50-100. The 500-1000 band churns at 2x the rate due to enterprise HRIS migrations."</p>

        <h3>HR Maturity Correlation</h3>
        <p>Does HR team sophistication predict your success? We segment by HR maturity indicators and analyze buying patterns across the spectrum.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Companies with dedicated HR Ops or People Analytics roles close 2x faster and expand at 3x the rate. Presence of these titles should be a lead scoring factor."</p>

        <h3>HRIS Ecosystem Analysis</h3>
        <p>Which core HRIS platforms correlate with your wins? We analyze your customer base by HRIS ecosystem to identify integration-driven patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers on BambooHR have 45% higher win rates than those on Workday. Your integration depth and buyer persona differ by ecosystem."</p>

        <h3>Growth Trajectory Patterns</h3>
        <p>Fast-growing companies have different HR needs than stable ones. We analyze how company growth rate correlates with buying behavior and expansion potential.</p>
        <p><strong>Example output:</strong> "Companies that grew 50%+ in the past year have 2x expansion rates but 40% higher churn. Target high-growth for land, stable for expand."</p>

        <h2>HR Tech-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Employee count bands.</strong> 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-1000, 1000-5000, 5000+. Each band has different compliance triggers, HR team structures, and technology maturity.</li>

          <li><strong>HR team maturity.</strong> Administrative (reactive, compliance-focused), operational (process-focused, some technology), strategic (People Ops, data-driven, tech-enabled). Maturity determines buying sophistication.</li>

          <li><strong>HRIS ecosystem.</strong> Core platform (Workday, BambooHR, ADP, Paylocity, Gusto, etc.) drives integration requirements and competitive dynamics.</li>

          <li><strong>HR team structure.</strong> HR Generalist vs specialists, presence of HRBP model, dedicated People Analytics or HR Ops roles. Structure signals maturity and budget.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry-specific HR needs.</strong> Hourly workforce industries (retail, hospitality, healthcare) vs knowledge worker industries have different HR technology priorities.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth trajectory.</strong> Rapidly scaling companies have urgent HR needs. Stable companies have optimization needs. Contracting companies may not be buyers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your HR Tech market position, product category, and the questions driving your segmentation challenges.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible and recommend any enrichment that would help.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across HR-specific dimensions. Employee bands, maturity signals, HRIS ecosystem, growth patterns. The analysis is built around how HR teams buy technology.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which employee bands to focus on, what maturity signals to prioritize, which ecosystems drive the best outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring adjustments, and account prioritization frameworks.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What HR Tech data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your HR Tech sales data to identify your ideal customer profile by employee count bands, HR team maturity, and HRIS ecosystem. We segment accounts by likelihood to buy and expand, predict churn, and find patterns in win/loss data specific to HR technology buyers.</p>

          <h3>How does employee count correlation work for HR Tech ICP?</h3>
          <p>HR Tech buying behavior changes dramatically at certain employee thresholds: 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 5000. Each band triggers different compliance requirements, HR team structures, and technology needs. We analyze how your wins correlate with these employee bands.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze HR maturity as a buying signal?</h3>
          <p>Yes. HR maturity spans from administrative-focused teams running on spreadsheets to strategic People Operations functions with dedicated HR tech stacks. Maturity level affects buying process, budget authority, and solution requirements. We help you understand which maturity level drives your best outcomes.</p>

          <h3>What if we sell both to HR and to other departments?</h3>
          <p>Many HR-adjacent tools sell to multiple buyers. We analyze whether HR-led deals perform differently than IT-led or Finance-led deals to help you prioritize your go-to-market approach.</p>
