        <h2>The E-commerce Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to e-commerce brands, D2C companies, or retailers with online operations. Your CRM has company names and maybe a website. That's not enough to run an effective sales motion.</p>

        <p>E-commerce company data is fragmented. D2C brands are often small and private, making firmographics hard to find. Decision-makers have varied titles. Platform and tech stack information requires technical detection. Your SDRs spend hours researching each prospect before they can start outreach.</p>

        <h3>Decision-makers are hard to identify</h3>
        <p>Who owns e-commerce at this company? Is it a VP of E-commerce, Head of Digital, or the CMO? For smaller D2C brands, the founder might be making all decisions. Without knowing the right contact, you're guessing who to reach.</p>

        <h3>Company data is incomplete</h3>
        <p>D2C brands don't publish revenue. Employee counts are often unavailable for smaller companies. You can't tell if this is a $1M startup or a $50M growth brand without research. Basic qualification becomes time-consuming.</p>

        <h3>Platform and tech stack is hidden</h3>
        <p>Are they on Shopify or Magento? What marketing tools do they use? For e-commerce platform vendors and app developers, understanding the current tech stack is essential for qualification and positioning. But detecting this requires technical analysis.</p>

        <h3>Growth signals are invisible</h3>
        <p>Which e-commerce brands are scaling? Who just raised funding? Which companies are hiring aggressively? Growth signals indicate buying potential, but they're not in your CRM.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the data that companies selling to e-commerce need to identify, qualify, and engage prospects effectively.</p>

        <h3>E-commerce decision-maker contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for the people who buy e-commerce technology and services. E-commerce directors, VP of Digital, CMOs, founders at D2C brands, merchandising directors at retailers. The people who make purchasing decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for target contacts.</p>

        <h3>Company firmographics</h3>
        <p>Estimated revenue ranges, employee counts, funding history, and company age. For D2C brands, we leverage funding data, job posting analysis, and traffic estimates to approximate company size when direct data isn't available.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Firmographic profiles enabling accurate qualification even for private companies.</p>

        <h3>E-commerce platform and tech stack</h3>
        <p>Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, custom platforms. We identify what e-commerce infrastructure companies are running. For platform vendors and app developers, this is essential qualification data.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Platform and tech stack data enabling targeted campaigns by technology.</p>

        <h3>Growth and funding signals</h3>
        <p>Recent funding rounds, hiring velocity, traffic growth trends, and expansion indicators. E-commerce companies that are scaling are more likely to be buying tools and services. We provide signals that indicate growth.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Growth signals enabling prioritization of high-potential prospects.</p>

        <h3>Category and product data</h3>
        <p>What does this e-commerce company sell? Apparel, beauty, food, electronics? Category data helps you personalize outreach and identify vertical-specific opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Category classifications enabling segment-specific campaigns.</p>
