        <h2>The Retail Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell technology, services, or products to retailers. Your CRM contains national chains, regional retailers, DTC brands, and e-commerce companies. But the retail landscape is in constant upheaval.</p>

        <p>That retailer you've been pursuing? Filed for bankruptcy and closed half their stores. The buyer you built a relationship with? Left for a competitor. The e-commerce brand on your target list? Got acquired by a larger player. Your database reflects a retail landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Retail data has unique challenges. Store closures, bankruptcies, and the shift to e-commerce mean your prospect data ages faster than you'd expect.</p>

        <h3>Retail bankruptcies and closures continue</h3>
        <p>Retailers file for bankruptcy, close stores, and restructure. Chains that were household names disappear or shrink dramatically. Your target account list includes retailers that no longer exist or operate at a fraction of their former scale.</p>

        <h3>Retail executives move frequently</h3>
        <p>Buyers, merchandisers, and e-commerce leaders are in high demand. Restructuring, cost-cutting, and aggressive recruiting drive turnover. The decision-maker you've been nurturing might be at a completely different company than your CRM shows.</p>

        <h3>The retail landscape keeps shifting</h3>
        <p>Traditional retailers pivot to e-commerce. DTC brands open physical stores. Brands get acquired or go direct. Your data doesn't capture who's thriving, who's struggling, or who's fundamentally changed their business model.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought retailer databases, buyer lists, e-commerce company contacts. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different accuracy levels. Now you have the same company five times with conflicting information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for retail sales. Tight margins and competitive pressure mean you can't afford to waste time pursuing retailers that closed or contacts who moved.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Retail Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy retail database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that retailers still operate, flag those that have filed for bankruptcy or closed, and update records where we can identify current status.</p>
        <p><strong>For retail sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing retailers that closed. Know when companies are in distress. Focus on healthy retailers that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names vary or data came from different sources. We handle parent-subsidiary relationships and brand portfolios.</p>
        <p><strong>For retail sales teams:</strong> One clean record per company. Clear understanding of brand ownership. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Departures and moves get flagged.</p>
        <p><strong>For retail sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current companies. Know when buyers move. Maintain relationships across job changes.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, retail categories, and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For retail sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by retail type and size. Target department stores differently from specialty retailers. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Retail Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on healthy retailers.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on retailers in bankruptcy or chains that closed. Every account in your database represents a real company that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track buyer moves.</strong> When decision-makers move between retailers, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people change employers.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate brand portfolios.</strong> Understand parent company ownership and which brands sit under which corporate umbrellas. Know where purchasing decisions are actually made.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by retail type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target e-commerce differently from brick-and-mortar, national chains differently from regional players. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your retail database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Retail changes fast. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Retail Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of retail data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Retailer databases, brand contact lists, e-commerce company data, CPG buyer contacts, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the retail and consumer goods industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you track retail company bankruptcies and closures?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate company names against current data and can flag records where retailers have filed bankruptcy, closed stores, or shut down entirely. This is especially valuable given the ongoing changes in retail.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle brand portfolio complexity?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can help clarify parent company ownership and which brands belong to which corporate structures. Understanding retail ownership is part of what we do.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our retail data?</h3>
          <p>Given the pace of change in retail, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant industry news (bankruptcies, acquisitions, closures).</p>
