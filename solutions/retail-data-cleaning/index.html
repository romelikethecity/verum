        <h2>The Retail Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're running a retail operation with stores, e-commerce, and loyalty programs. Your systems hold years of customer transactions and vendor relationships. But that data has become fragmented across channels.</p>

        <p>Retail data degrades fast. Customers use different emails for online and in-store purchases. Loyalty programs capture partial information. POS systems create new records for every transaction. Your single customer view is actually multiple incomplete views that don't connect.</p>

        <h3>Customers are fragmented across channels</h3>
        <p>The same customer shops in-store, orders online, and uses your app. Each channel created a separate profile. Your loyalty program shows three small accounts instead of one valuable customer. Personalization fails because you don't know who you're talking to.</p>

        <h3>Loyalty data doesn't match transactions</h3>
        <p>Customers sign up for loyalty programs with one email and checkout with another. Loyalty points don't accumulate correctly. Members get frustrated. Your program's effectiveness suffers because you can't attribute purchases to the right profiles.</p>

        <h3>Email lists are degraded</h3>
        <p>Customers change emails, abandon old addresses, and unsubscribe from multiple profiles. Your marketing campaigns hit bounces and duplicates. Sender reputation suffers. You're paying to reach addresses that don't work.</p>

        <h3>Vendor and supplier data is messy</h3>
        <p>The same vendor appears under different names from different buyers. Contact information is outdated. Product catalogs are inconsistent. Your procurement and merchandising systems work with unreliable data.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Retail Data</h2>

        <p>We understand omnichannel retail data. Customer databases that span stores, e-commerce, and loyalty programs. Vendor relationships across multiple categories. We clean it all while preserving the transaction history that makes it valuable.</p>

        <h3>Customer deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match customer records across emails, phone numbers, loyalty IDs, addresses, and name variations. We understand that the same person creates profiles in different channels. We consolidate while preserving complete purchase history from all sources.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per customer with complete transaction history, plus merge logs showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Loyalty program cleanup</h3>
        <p>We match loyalty accounts to transaction data and consolidate fragmented member profiles. Points get attributed correctly. Member tiers reflect true customer value. Your loyalty program works as intended.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consolidated loyalty profiles with accurate point balances and purchase attribution.</p>

        <h3>Email validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses for deliverability. We identify invalid addresses, catch-all domains, and high-risk emails. Your marketing campaigns reach real customers instead of bouncing.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with risk flags on problematic addresses.</p>

        <h3>Vendor standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize vendor names, validate contacts, and standardize product data across your supplier databases. Your procurement and merchandising teams work with consistent, reliable data.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent vendor records enabling accurate spend analysis and relationship management.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Build true customer profiles.</strong> When all channels are connected, you see each customer's full relationship with your brand.</li>
          <li><strong>Fix loyalty programs.</strong> Consolidated profiles mean accurate points, correct tier status, and members who trust your program.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve email performance.</strong> Validated addresses mean higher deliverability and better sender reputation.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize effectively.</strong> Clean data enables the personalization that drives retail sales.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your analytics.</strong> Accurate customer counts and purchase data mean your business intelligence reflects reality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull customer, loyalty, and vendor data from your retail systems. We work with exports from major POS, e-commerce, and CRM platforms.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, channel fragmentation, and inconsistencies. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex customer matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>
