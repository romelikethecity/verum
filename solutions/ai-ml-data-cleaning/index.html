        <h2>The AI/ML Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>The AI space moves faster than any other industry. Companies pivot, rebrand, get acquired, and shut down constantly. The startup you added six months ago might be a completely different company now. Or it might not exist at all.</p>

        <p>AI/ML companies have unique data challenges. Your leads come from technical communities like Hugging Face and GitHub. Conference badges get scanned indiscriminately. Free tier users sign up with personal emails. And distinguishing between researchers doing academic work and practitioners at companies with budget is nearly impossible without clean, enriched data.</p>

        <h3>Personal and academic emails everywhere</h3>
        <p>ML practitioners sign up with .edu addresses, personal gmail accounts, or company domains you've never heard of. You can't run effective outreach to these contacts, and you don't know which ones represent real enterprise opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Researchers vs practitioners</h3>
        <p>That lead from NeurIPS might be a PhD student at a university or the head of ML at a Fortune 500 company. Your CRM can't tell the difference. Without qualification data, your SDRs waste time on leads that will never convert.</p>

        <h3>AI companies change constantly</h3>
        <p>The generative AI startup you added last year pivoted to enterprise. Or got acquired. Or shut down when funding dried up. AI has the highest volatility of any tech sector, and your CRM data ages faster than you can update it.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates from multiple communities</h3>
        <p>The same ML engineer downloaded your model on Hugging Face, attended your workshop at a conference, signed up for your product, and submitted through your website. Four records, same person, different information on each.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans AI/ML Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the specific challenges of AI/ML company data. Technical community sources. Academic vs enterprise distinctions. Rapidly changing company landscapes. We clean your data to make it actually useful for sales.</p>

        <h3>Lead deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match leads across emails, GitHub profiles, company domains, and name variations. We consolidate records from Hugging Face, conferences, product signups, and inbound forms into single golden records.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One clean record per lead with complete engagement history preserved.</p>

        <h3>Academic vs enterprise classification</h3>
        <p>We identify which leads are academic researchers vs industry practitioners. University affiliations, company verification, and role analysis help you focus on leads with actual buying potential.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Classification data distinguishing researchers from enterprise buyers.</p>

        <h3>Personal email enrichment</h3>
        <p>For leads with personal or academic emails, we identify their work email and company when possible. This transforms unusable leads into qualified B2B contacts.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Work emails and company attribution for previously unidentifiable leads.</p>

        <h3>Company validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that AI companies still exist, haven't pivoted significantly, and are operating as you expect. We flag acquisitions, shutdowns, and major pivots so you're not pursuing dead leads.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Validated company data with current status flags.</p>

        <h2>What AI/ML Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on enterprise, not academia.</strong> Classification data lets you prioritize practitioners at companies with budget over researchers doing academic work.</li>
          <li><strong>Convert PLG users to sales leads.</strong> When personal email users are enriched with work contacts, you can run proper outbound to your best product users.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop chasing dead leads.</strong> When pivoted or defunct AI companies are flagged, your SDRs focus on opportunities that can actually close.</li>
          <li><strong>Run accurate attribution.</strong> Clean, deduplicated data means your marketing attribution across technical communities actually shows what's working.</li>
          <li><strong>Track job changes.</strong> ML practitioners move frequently. Clean data shows when contacts have changed roles, creating new opportunities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull leads from your CRM, product database, or community platforms. We work with exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, Segment, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, personal email percentages, academic vs enterprise mix, and company validation issues. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, classification, enrichment. Human review on edge cases. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle AI startup duplicates and pivots?</h3>
          <p>AI companies pivot frequently, rebrand, and get acquired at high rates. We track these changes and flag records accordingly. We match companies across name variations, domains, and founding team patterns.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean developer and ML practitioner contact data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. AI/ML companies often have leads from Hugging Face, GitHub, Kaggle, and technical conferences. We dedupe across these sources, validate technical email addresses, and enrich personal emails to work domains.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with product-led growth user databases?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. We clean PLG databases by deduplicating users, enriching personal emails to work domains, and identifying enterprise accounts within your user base.</p>

          <h3>How long does AI/ML data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most AI/ML CRM cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Large PLG databases may take 3-5 business days.</p>

          <h3>Can you distinguish between researchers and practitioners?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We use university affiliations, company verification, job titles, and role analysis to classify leads as academic researchers vs industry practitioners with buying potential.</p>
