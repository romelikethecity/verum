        <h2>The AI Company Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Your engineering team builds sophisticated ML pipelines. Your data scientists obsess over training data quality. But your sales and marketing data? It's chaos.</p>

        <p>The CRM has grown organically over funding rounds. Leads from conferences, demo requests, investor intros, product signups. Nobody standardized anything. Now your SDRs spend more time figuring out if a lead is real than actually selling.</p>

        <p>This is the irony nobody talks about at AI companies.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates multiply with every data source</h3>
        <p>Same prospect, five different records. One from a conference scan. One from a demo request. One from an investor intro. One from LinkedIn outreach. One from a product signup. Your SDRs don't know which is current. Your sequences hit the same person multiple times. Your pipeline reports are fiction.</p>

        <h3>Technical buyers change jobs constantly</h3>
        <p>The ML engineers and data scientists you're targeting are in high demand. They change jobs frequently. That Director of ML you've been nurturing? Left three months ago. But your CRM still shows them at the old company. Your outbound keeps hitting dead ends.</p>

        <h3>Startup data is inherently messy</h3>
        <p>You're selling to startups and enterprises. Startups get acquired, pivot, run out of funding, or explode in growth. Your target account list from last quarter is already stale. Companies that fit your ICP six months ago might not exist anymore.</p>

        <h3>Event and conference leads are the worst</h3>
        <p>Badge scans from AI conferences. Business cards hastily entered. Webinar registrations with typos. Demo requests with personal emails. This data comes in messy and stays messy. It sits in your CRM polluting your targeting until someone cleans it.</p>

        <p>You can't run effective outbound with dirty data. Your personalization fails when job titles are wrong. Your account-based motions break when company data is stale. Your SDRs lose trust in the CRM and start keeping their own spreadsheets.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See How Clean Data Transforms Outbound</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans AI Company Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy CRM and prospect data and make it usable for outbound. No platform to learn. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when they came from different sources with different formats. We merge intelligently, preserving the most recent and complete information from each duplicate.</p>
        <p><strong>For AI company GTM teams:</strong> One clean record per prospect. Sequences that don't embarrass you. Pipeline numbers you can trust.</p>

        <h3>Email Validation and Verification</h3>
        <p>We check every email against multiple validation sources. Syntax errors, invalid domains, role-based addresses, known bounces. Bad emails get flagged before they hurt your sender reputation.</p>
        <p><strong>For AI company GTM teams:</strong> Higher deliverability. Fewer bounces. Outbound that actually reaches inboxes.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize job titles, company names, phone formats, and every other field into consistent formats. "Dir of ML" becomes "Director of Machine Learning." Your segmentation and personalization actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For AI company GTM teams:</strong> Targeting rules that fire correctly. Personalization that doesn't look broken. Data that flows between systems.</p>

        <h3>Company Data Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify company names against business registries, check for acquisitions and name changes, and validate that your target accounts still exist and match your ICP.</p>
        <p><strong>For AI company GTM teams:</strong> Account lists you can trust. ABM campaigns that target real companies. No more outreach to defunct startups.</p>

        <h2>What AI Company GTM Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run outbound that actually works.</strong> When emails are valid and contacts are current, your sequences reach people. Reply rates go up. Meetings get booked.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline numbers.</strong> Deduplicated data means your opportunity counts are real. Forecasting works when the underlying data is clean.</li>

          <li><strong>Personalize without embarrassment.</strong> When job titles and company names are standardized, your personalization doesn't look broken. No more "Hi {FirstName}" disasters.</li>

          <li><strong>Focus SDR time on selling.</strong> Your team stops playing data detective and starts having conversations. Clean data means they can trust what's in the CRM.</li>

          <li><strong>Make ABM actually work.</strong> Account-based motions require accurate company data. When your account lists are clean and current, your ABM campaigns target real opportunities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of what cleaning can realistically accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack and data sources. HubSpot? Salesforce? Outreach? Apollo? We've worked with exports from all of them.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample export. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Data gets dirty again. New leads come in messy. We can run periodic cleaning to keep your CRM healthy. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About AI Company Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets or complex requirements might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>CRM exports, prospect lists, customer databases, event leads, investor contacts, and any B2B data your go-to-market team uses. We focus on sales and marketing data—the stuff that drives revenue.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from data enrichment?</h3>
          <p>Data cleaning fixes what you have—removing duplicates, standardizing formats, validating emails. Data enrichment adds new information like company size, funding stage, or tech stack. Most AI companies need both, and we offer both services.</p>

          <h3>What CRMs and tools do you work with?</h3>
          <p>Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Outreach, Apollo, and any system that can export data. If you can get it into a CSV or spreadsheet, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle sensitive data?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, secure processing, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. Standard security practices that AI companies expect.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean data from multiple sources?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We often receive exports from CRM, marketing automation, and sales engagement tools simultaneously. We can clean and deduplicate across all sources, giving you one unified clean dataset.</p>
