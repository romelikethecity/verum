        <h2>The Construction Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to contractors, builders, or construction owner organizations. Your CRM has company names and maybe a general office number. That's not enough to run an effective sales motion in construction.</p>

        <p>Construction data is notoriously hard to get. Contractors don't put their project managers' direct lines online. Decision-makers vary by project type and size. Firmographic data like annual revenue and specialty focus lives in scattered databases. Your SDRs spend hours researching each account before they can start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>Contacts are hidden</h3>
        <p>General contractors protect their estimators and project managers. You might find a main office number, but good luck reaching the PM who actually specifies materials and equipment. Generic emails go to reception. Without direct contact data, you're not getting through.</p>

        <h3>Company size is unclear</h3>
        <p>Is this a $10M regional contractor or a $500M national GC? Annual revenue determines everything about how you sell to them. But construction companies don't publish their financials, and employee count is a rough proxy at best.</p>

        <h3>Specialty focus is hard to determine</h3>
        <p>Does this contractor do commercial, residential, industrial, or all three? Healthcare projects require different qualifications than warehouse builds. Understanding their specialty focus is essential for qualification, but it's not always obvious from a company name.</p>

        <h3>Project activity is invisible</h3>
        <p>Who has an active backlog? Who's bidding new work? Timing matters in construction sales. If you catch a contractor during bidding, your product might make it into the spec. After award, you're competing against relationships already established.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that construction sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage contractors and owner organizations.</p>

        <h3>Decision-maker contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for construction decision-makers. Project managers, estimators, procurement directors, superintendents, company principals. The people your reps need to reach, with contact info that works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for target contacts.</p>

        <h3>Company firmographics</h3>
        <p>Revenue ranges, employee count, years in business, geographic coverage. The metrics that determine if a contractor is in your target range and how to position your solution for their scale.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firmographic profiles for construction company targets.</p>

        <h3>Specialty and capability data</h3>
        <p>Project types (commercial, residential, industrial, infrastructure), specialties (healthcare, education, data centers), and capability indicators. Understanding what they build helps you qualify fit and personalize outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Specialty classifications enabling targeted campaigns by project type.</p>

        <h3>License and certification data</h3>
        <p>Contractor licenses, bonding capacity, safety certifications, and prequalification status where available. These credentials signal capability and often indicate purchasing authority levels.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Credential data enabling qualification and relevant positioning.</p>

        <h3>Project activity signals</h3>
        <p>Recent project awards, permit activity, and hiring signals that indicate active construction. Companies with growing backlogs and new project wins are more likely to be purchasing materials and services.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Activity signals enabling timely outreach to companies with current needs.</p>

        <h2>What Construction Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach actual decision-makers.</strong> With project managers and estimators identified, you're reaching the people who influence material and equipment decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by company size.</strong> Revenue and employee data lets you instantly tier contractors. Sell enterprise solutions to enterprise GCs, regional solutions to regional builders.</li>
          <li><strong>Target by specialty.</strong> Healthcare contractors get healthcare messaging. Industrial builders get industrial messaging. Specialty data enables relevant outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Time outreach to activity.</strong> Project award and permit signals help you reach contractors when they're actively purchasing, not during slow periods.</li>
          <li><strong>Understand contractor organizations.</strong> Understanding company structure helps you identify whether to target field staff, home office, or both.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Company names, target segments, whatever accounts you're working. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Decision-maker contacts? Company firmographics? Specialty data? Project signals? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>
