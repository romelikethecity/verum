        <h2>The Construction Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's bid day. You need to pull together quotes from your trusted electrical subs for a commercial project downtown. You've worked with three of them before. Good relationships. Reliable work.</p>

        <p>First one's number is disconnected. Second one's email bounces. Third one closed shop during the pandemic. Your "trusted subcontractor list" is suddenly a lot shorter than you thought. The bid is due tomorrow.</p>

        <p>You start cold-calling electrical contractors you've never worked with, hoping to find someone with capacity and credentials before the deadline.</p>

        <h3>The construction industry churns faster than your database</h3>
        <p>About one in five construction businesses fail within their first five years. Others get acquired, change names, or quietly stop taking new projects. The subcontractor who did great work on your last job might not be answering their phone today. Your vendor database doesn't update itself.</p>

        <h3>Project managers and estimators move constantly</h3>
        <p>Contact data decays at roughly 30% per year across all industries. In construction, with its project-based nature and job-to-job movement, turnover can be even higher. The estimator you knew at ABC Mechanical? She's at XYZ now. Your CRM still shows her old email.</p>

        <h3>Qualification and licensing data goes stale</h3>
        <p>Certifications expire. Insurance lapses. Licenses need renewal. The fact that a sub was qualified last year doesn't mean they're qualified today. But tracking all of that manually across hundreds of subcontractors is a full-time job nobody has time for.</p>

        <h3>Regional expansion multiplies the problem</h3>
        <p>When you take on projects in new markets, you need to build subcontractor networks fast. But finding reliable subs in an unfamiliar area means starting from scratch. Your existing relationships don't translate, and you don't have time to vet everyone properly before the first bid.</p>

        <p>Every dead phone number is a bid that almost didn't happen. Every email bounce is a relationship that drifted away. Every expired license you missed is a compliance risk you didn't see coming.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Construction Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a dedicated admin just to know which subs are still in business. Verum takes your subcontractor databases, vendor lists, and CRM exports, and makes them current. We verify contacts, update company information, and flag issues. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating phone numbers, and verifying email addresses. When a project manager moves to a new company, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For construction teams:</strong> Stop calling disconnected numbers on bid day. Know when your best estimator contacts moved companies.</p>

        <h3>Company Verification</h3>
        <p>Is that subcontractor still in business? Did they merge with someone else? Have they changed their company name? We verify organizational status so you're not chasing ghosts.</p>
        <p><strong>For construction teams:</strong> Remove closed businesses from your bid lists. Know which companies are still active before you reach out.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Service areas? Specialties? We fill in the gaps so your subcontractor segmentation actually works. Know which subs handle $50K jobs versus $5M jobs.</p>
        <p><strong>For construction teams:</strong> Match the right subs to the right projects. Stop asking residential electricians to bid on commercial high-rises.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But construction data has quirks. DBAs, joint ventures, parent companies with multiple operating subsidiaries. Every file gets human review before delivery.</p>

        <h2>What Construction Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Bid with confidence.</strong> When you need three electrical bids by Friday, you know which subs are actually in business and have current contact information. No more scrambling.</li>

          <li><strong>Build subcontractor relationships that last.</strong> Track when contacts move companies. When your favorite estimator lands somewhere new, you can follow the relationship.</li>

          <li><strong>Expand into new markets faster.</strong> Clean data helps you identify active contractors in new regions. Know who's operating where before you need them for a bid.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce prequalification headaches.</strong> Start with accurate company information so your prequalification process isn't fighting bad data from the start.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment subs by capability.</strong> Know which contractors handle which project sizes and types. Send the right RFQs to the right companies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your systems, data sources, and specific challenges. Procore? Buildertrend? Custom database? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Construction data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or clean up before major bid seasons. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Why Construction Leaders Choose Verum</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>We do the work.</strong> This isn't another platform to learn. Send us your data, get clean data back. Your team stays focused on projects.</li>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Clean your sub list before bid season, not during it.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Important for construction's complex corporate structures.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Project-based pricing fits construction cash flows.</li>

          <li><strong>We understand construction.</strong> GCs versus subs versus suppliers. Bonding requirements versus insurance certificates. DBAs versus LLCs. We know the domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About Construction Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. No IT project required.</p>

          <h3>Can you verify contractor licenses?</h3>
          <p>We can flag license data for verification and cross-reference against available public databases. For official verification, we recommend checking with your state licensing board, but we can identify which records need attention and which companies appear to have current credentials.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with construction management software?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We've worked with exports from Procore, Buildertrend, CoConstruct, and most major platforms. If your system can export data, we can clean it. We'll return it in whatever format you need.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new subcontractor names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of subcontractor relationships and now that data is stale? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. Your subcontractor network is competitive intelligence. We treat it that way.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with local contractors and national GCs. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of project volume. A sub list with 200 contacts has the same decay issues as one with 20,000.</p>
