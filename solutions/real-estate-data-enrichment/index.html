        <h2>The Real Estate Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's a slow Tuesday morning. Your brokerage's top producer decides to finally work that database of past clients. She knows there's gold in there. People who closed three years ago and might be ready to sell. Past leads who weren't ready but might be now.</p>

        <p>She opens the CRM. First ten calls: four disconnected numbers, two wrong people entirely, one who's annoyed she's calling again, and three who actually pick up. Two of those three already listed with someone else. One says maybe next year.</p>

        <p>Three hours in, she's made 40 calls and had exactly two real conversations. The database has 2,000 contacts. At this rate, she'd need months to work through it. She closes the laptop and goes back to open houses.</p>

        <p>This happens constantly in real estate. Agents collect contact data for years, but when they actually need it, half of it doesn't work.</p>

        <h3>CRM adoption sounds good on paper</h3>
        <p>About <a href="https://llcbuddy.com/data/real-estate-crm-software-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72.5% of real estate professionals</a> use CRM software now. That number has grown from 56% in recent years. But adoption isn't the same as effectiveness. Research puts CRM failure rates between 18% and 69%, depending on how you measure it. Getting the tool is easy. Getting value from it is another story.</p>

        <h3>The data decay problem is relentless</h3>
        <p>Contact data decays at roughly 25% per year. People move. Phone numbers change. Email addresses become obsolete. In real estate, the turnover is even faster. That lead from two years ago? There's a one-in-four chance their contact info is already wrong. Multiply that across thousands of records and you've got a database full of dead ends.</p>

        <h3>Agents collect data but don't use it</h3>
        <p>Most real estate agents collect a lot of client information but do little to turn it into actual sales. The difference between a top producer and everyone else often comes down to how they mine this data. But mining takes time. And when the data is bad, that time is wasted.</p>

        <h3>More than 40% of CRM features go unused</h3>
        <p>Most businesses use fewer than half of the available CRM features. It's not because the features aren't useful. It's because the underlying data is too messy to make them work. Lead scoring doesn't help when half your leads have wrong phone numbers. Automated follow-ups don't help when emails bounce.</p>

        <p>The math is simple. Bad data means wasted calls, bounced emails, and missed opportunities. Your team deserves better than spending half their day verifying information that should already be clean.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Real Estate Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need to hire someone just to clean up your CRM. Verum takes the decaying, incomplete, duplicate-riddled data across your systems and makes it usable. We cross-reference multiple sources, verify contacts, and fill in gaps. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging people who've moved, updating phone numbers, and filling in missing emails. When someone changes brokerages or relocates, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For real estate teams:</strong> Stop calling disconnected numbers. Stop emailing addresses that bounce. Your agents spend time selling, not researching.</p>

        <h3>Lead Prioritization Data</h3>
        <p>Not all leads are equal. We can append homeownership data, estimated home values, time in residence, and other signals that help you prioritize who to call first.</p>
        <p><strong>For real estate teams:</strong> Focus on the prospects most likely to transact. Know who's been in their home for 7+ years and might be ready to move.</p>

        <h3>Agent and Broker Enrichment</h3>
        <p>If you're selling to real estate professionals, we can verify and enrich your agent database. License status, current brokerage, production history signals.</p>
        <p><strong>For real estate vendors:</strong> Know which agents are active and at which brokerages. Stop marketing to people who left the industry.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Real estate data has quirks. Agent teams with shared phone numbers. Properties with multiple owners. We catch what automated systems miss.</p>

        <h2>What Real Estate Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Actually work your sphere of influence.</strong> Clean data on past clients means you can run effective drip campaigns. Anniversary emails that actually land. Check-ins that reach the right people.</li>

          <li><strong>Prioritize leads that will actually convert.</strong> Know who's been in their home longest, who's in a growing family situation, who might be ready to move. Focus where it matters.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce cold calling waste by 50%+.</strong> When phone numbers actually work and people actually live where you think they do, your connect rates go up dramatically.</li>

          <li><strong>Track agent recruiting targets.</strong> If you're a brokerage recruiting agents, clean data on who's producing, where they are, and how to reach them makes all the difference.</li>

          <li><strong>Clean up years of accumulated records.</strong> Most databases have duplicates, dead leads, and contacts who moved away years ago. We help you separate signal from noise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Follow Up Boss? kvCORE? Chime? BoomTown? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 25% annual decay, real estate data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Real Estate Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich data on agents and brokers?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can verify and enrich contact data for agents, brokers, and industry professionals. License status, current brokerage affiliations, production history signals. Useful if you're a vendor selling to real estate professionals or a brokerage doing recruiting.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with our CRM?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, Chime, BoomTown, LionDesk, Wise Agent, and most others. If your system can export data, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new leads, that's their strength. But if you already have years of contacts from open houses, past transactions, and lead generation, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh in six months? Pay for that refresh.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with teams of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with solo agents, mega teams, and enterprise brokerages. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A database of 500 contacts has the same decay issues as one with 50,000.</p>
