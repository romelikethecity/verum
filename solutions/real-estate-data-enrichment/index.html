        <h2>The Real Estate Data Gap Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to real estate professionals. You know your target markets and agent profiles. But your CRM has names and maybe office phone numbers. That's not enough to reach busy agents who are constantly on the go.</p>

        <p>Real estate is a massive, fragmented industry. 1.5 million active agents across thousands of brokerages. Most agents work as independent contractors with minimal online presence. Your SDRs are spending hours researching each prospect just to find contact information that works.</p>

        <h3>Contact data is hard to find</h3>
        <p>Agents don't have corporate email addresses. Office phone numbers go to brokerage front desks. Personal cell phones are guarded carefully. Without verified direct contact data, you're playing phone tag with receptionists instead of talking to agents.</p>

        <h3>Production data is scattered</h3>
        <p>You want to target top producers, not part-time agents. But transaction volume data is locked in MLS systems, scattered across public records, and rarely attached to contact records. You can't tell the $10M producer from the $100K one.</p>

        <h3>Brokerage affiliation changes constantly</h3>
        <p>The agent's profile says RE/MAX but they moved to Compass last month. Without current brokerage data, your outreach references the wrong company and gets ignored.</p>

        <h3>License and designation data is missing</h3>
        <p>Is this agent actually licensed? Do they have their broker's license? Any designations like CRS or ABR? These qualifications matter for targeting but they're rarely in CRM records.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the data real estate tech and service companies need to reach and qualify agents and brokerages.</p>

        <h3>Agent contact data</h3>
        <p>Verified personal emails, mobile phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles. The contact information agents actually respond to, not brokerage main lines. We verify deliverability on every email.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct phone numbers where available.</p>

        <h3>License and designation data</h3>
        <p>License numbers, license status (active/inactive), license type (salesperson/broker), expiration dates, and professional designations (CRS, ABR, GRI). We verify against state commission databases.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete license profiles with verification status and designations.</p>

        <h3>Production indicators</h3>
        <p>Transaction volume estimates, team membership, production tier classifications. We use multiple signals including MLS data, public records, and market indicators to identify top producers.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Production tier data to help you prioritize outreach to high-value agents.</p>

        <h3>Current brokerage affiliation</h3>
        <p>Which brokerage are they actually at right now? We verify current affiliations and flag recent changes. You stop reaching out to agents at companies they left months ago.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Current, verified brokerage affiliation with change detection.</p>

        <h3>Brokerage firmographics</h3>
        <p>For brokerage-level targeting: agent count, office locations, geographic coverage, franchise vs independent, tech stack, and key decision-makers. The data you need for enterprise real estate sales.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete brokerage profiles for account-based targeting.</p>

        <h2>What Real Estate Tech Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Target top producers.</strong> Production data lets you focus on agents who actually close deals, not the 80% who do minimal transactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach agents directly.</strong> Mobile numbers and personal emails mean your outreach gets to agents, not brokerage gatekeepers.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize by brokerage.</strong> Current affiliation data enables relevant outreach that references their actual company.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by license type.</strong> Target broker-owners separately from individual agents with different messaging and offers.</li>
          <li><strong>Run brokerage-level ABM.</strong> Firmographic data enables enterprise sales motions targeting entire brokerages with mapped decision-makers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Agent names, brokerages, whatever you have. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Contact data? Production tiers? Brokerage firmographics? We customize enrichment to your use case.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched agent lists immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What agent data can you enrich?</h3>
          <p>We enrich agent records with verified emails, direct phone numbers, license numbers and status, current brokerage, transaction history indicators, MLS memberships, and social profiles. For top producers, we can also identify team membership and production tier.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify top-producing agents?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We use multiple signals to identify production levels: MLS transaction data where available, team membership, awards and designations, and brokerage affiliation patterns. We can segment agents by estimated transaction volume.</p>

          <h3>Do you have brokerage-level data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We provide brokerage firmographics including agent count, office count, geographic coverage, franchise vs independent status, and tech stack data. For larger brokerages, we can identify key decision-makers.</p>

          <h3>What's your coverage for smaller markets?</h3>
          <p>Coverage varies by market size. Major metros have 90%+ enrichment rates. Smaller markets and rural areas have 70-80% rates. We can give you expected match rates for your specific geography before you commit.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying agent lists?</h3>
          <p>We enrich your existing data rather than selling generic lists. Pricing is per-project, not annual subscriptions. And you own the data forever. We're improving data you already have context on.</p>
        </div>
