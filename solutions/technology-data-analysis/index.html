        <h2>The Technology Sales Analysis Problem</h2>

        <p>Technology companies vary enormously. Bootstrapped vs. venture-backed. Early-stage vs. mature. Product-led vs. sales-led. Developer-focused vs. business-user-focused. These differences matter more than company size for predicting sales success.</p>

        <p>Most tech vendors segment by employee count or funding stage. But a 100-person Series B company might be a better customer than a 1,000-person public company—or vice versa. The patterns are in your data.</p>

        <h3>Tech stacks predict buying behavior</h3>
        <p>Companies using AWS tend to buy different tools than those on Azure. Salesforce shops have different needs than HubSpot users. Kubernetes adopters behave differently than traditional infrastructure users. Stack compatibility often predicts success.</p>

        <h3>Growth stage affects everything</h3>
        <p>Hypergrowth companies buy differently than stable ones. Early-stage companies have different priorities than mature enterprises. Understanding how growth stage correlates with your success helps focus prospecting.</p>

        <h3>The M&A factor</h3>
        <p>Tech companies get acquired constantly. Your customer might be absorbed into a larger organization next quarter. Understanding which segments are acquisition targets—and how that affects retention—shapes customer success strategy.</p>

        <h2>What Technology Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <h3>ICP by Tech Stack and Stage</h3>
        <p>Which technology profiles have the highest win rates? Best expansion? We analyze across multiple dimensions to find your true ICP beyond company size.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "AWS-native companies with 50-200 employees have 2.5x better retention than on-prem enterprise. Cloud-native architecture is a stronger predictor than company size."</p>

        <h3>Growth Velocity Analysis</h3>
        <p>How does customer growth rate correlate with your success? Fast-growing vs. stable companies may have very different patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Companies growing 50%+ annually have 40% higher churn—they outgrow your solution or get acquired. Stable 10-30% growth companies have best LTV."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Platform Patterns</h3>
        <p>Which customers expand? What behaviors predict cross-sell success? We identify the expansion signals in your data.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers who integrate with CI/CD pipeline in first month expand at 3x the rate. Developer adoption is the key expansion lever."</p>

        <h3>Competitive and Displacement Analysis</h3>
        <p>Which existing tools do you successfully replace? Which competitive situations do you win? We find patterns in your win/loss data.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "You win 80% of deals where the incumbent is open source. You lose 70% where enterprise competitor is entrenched. Qualification should emphasize incumbent type."</p>

        <h2>Technology-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> Cloud platform, development tools, business applications. Stack compatibility often predicts success.</li>

          <li><strong>Company stage.</strong> Seed to Series D to public. Growth stage affects buying behavior, budget, and decision processes.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth velocity.</strong> Hypergrowth vs. stable vs. declining. Growth rate correlates with expansion potential and churn risk.</li>

          <li><strong>Engineering culture.</strong> Developer-led vs. top-down. Build vs. buy tendencies. Technical sophistication level.</li>

          <li><strong>Business model.</strong> SaaS, marketplace, services, hardware. Business model affects buying priorities and budget cycles.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic and remote patterns.</strong> Distributed vs. centralized, US vs. international headquarters.</li>
        </ul>
