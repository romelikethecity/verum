        <h2>The Consulting Firm Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's the start of proposal season. Your practice lead is putting together a pitch for a major transformation project. She needs to understand the relationship history. Who at the firm knows who at the client? What work have we done before? Who's the sponsor we should approach?</p>

        <p>She opens the CRM. Three records for the target company, each with different contacts. The CFO listed retired two years ago. The VP of Operations moved to a competitor. The Chief Transformation Officer? Email bounces. Phone disconnected.</p>

        <p>Two hours later, she's cross-referenced LinkedIn, bothered three partners who might have connections, and built a spreadsheet she still doesn't fully trust. The pitch deadline is tomorrow.</p>

        <h3>Client contacts move constantly</h3>
        <p>Research shows 30% of contact data degrades every year. In consulting's target market of C-suite and senior executives, that number runs even higher. The sponsor who hired you for last year's project? They've probably been promoted, moved companies, or restructured out. Your CRM doesn't update itself.</p>

        <h3>Partners spend hours hunting for data instead of developing business</h3>
        <p>Validity research found workers spend 13 hours per week just hunting for basic information in their CRM. For consulting partners billing at $400/hour, that's $270,000 annually per partner in lost opportunity cost. Time that should go to client development goes to data archaeology.</p>

        <h3>Relationship intelligence is scattered everywhere</h3>
        <p>Some relationships live in the CRM. Some in partners' personal Outlook contacts. Some in the heads of long-tenured staff. Some in the billing system. Getting a complete picture of client relationships means pulling from five different sources and hoping they match.</p>

        <h3>Cross-sell opportunities hide in bad data</h3>
        <p>You know there's more business in existing clients. Every firm does. But pulling together engagement history, contact relationships, and service gaps across systems takes so long that opportunities go to competitors while you're still researching.</p>

        <p>Every wrong phone number is a cold call that should have been warm. Every bounced email is a relationship that's drifting away. Your partners deserve better than a CRM full of decay.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Consulting Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a full-time data steward just to keep your CRM useful. Verum takes the scattered, decaying, duplicate-riddled data across your systems and makes it work. We cross-reference multiple sources, verify contacts, and fill in gaps. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. When a CFO moves from one company to another, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For consulting firms:</strong> Stop sending proposals to people who left. Know when your sponsor gets promoted. Follow relationships even when people change roles.</p>

        <h3>Record Deduplication</h3>
        <p>"Acme Corp." "Acme Corporation." "ACME, Inc." Same client, three records. We merge them into one complete profile with full history. No more confusion about which record is current.</p>
        <p><strong>For consulting firms:</strong> See complete relationship history across all engagements. Know every project the firm has done for a client, not just the ones tied to your particular record.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Industry classification? We fill in the gaps so your targeting actually works. Know which clients are growing, which industries are consolidating, which companies just made acquisitions.</p>
        <p><strong>For consulting firms:</strong> Segment your business development by company size, industry, or growth stage. Know who might need M&A integration help, who's restructuring, who's expanding.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Consulting has quirks. Complex organizational structures, holding companies, clients that span multiple entities. We catch what automated systems miss.</p>

        <h2>What Consulting Firms Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Prepare for pitches in minutes, not hours.</strong> Pull complete client histories and contact relationships without the research scavenger hunt. Walk into meetings knowing the full picture.</li>

          <li><strong>Track alumni and referral sources.</strong> Former clients move to new companies. Past sponsors become potential clients elsewhere. Clean data lets you follow these relationships instead of losing them.</li>

          <li><strong>Identify cross-sell opportunities across practices.</strong> See complete client relationships across the entire firm. Know when strategy's client might need operations help, or when transformation could use technology support.</li>

          <li><strong>Onboard lateral partners without the data nightmare.</strong> When new partners join, give them a complete view of relevant relationships from day one.</li>

          <li><strong>Enable proper relationship attribution.</strong> Know which partner owns which relationship. Stop duplicating outreach to the same contacts from different practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? Microsoft Dynamics? Custom CRM? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 30% annual decay, consulting data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Consulting Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you track when our client contacts change roles?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We flag job changes proactively. Know when a sponsor gets promoted, moves companies, or leaves the role. This lets you follow relationships instead of losing them, and identify when past contacts become new opportunity sources.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with our CRM?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, HubSpot, and most other CRM platforms used by consulting firms. If your system can export data, we can clean it. If you want cleaned data pushed back in, we can work with your IT team on that too.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have decades of client relationships and prospect data, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh in six months? Pay for that refresh.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about confidentiality?</h3>
          <p>We work with contact and company information, not engagement details or deliverables. Encrypted transfers, NDAs available, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand consulting confidentiality requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with firms of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with boutique firms and global consultancies. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A CRM with 5,000 contacts has the same decay issues as one with 500,000.</p>
