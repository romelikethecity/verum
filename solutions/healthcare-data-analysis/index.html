        <h2>The Healthcare Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>Healthcare is a massive market with thousands of potential accounts. Hospitals, health systems, ambulatory surgery centers, physician practices, post-acute facilities. You can't pursue them all with equal intensity.</p>

        <p>Most companies selling to healthcare segment by obvious factors: bed count, geographic region, maybe health system vs. independent. But these broad categories hide the patterns that actually predict success.</p>

        <p>Which hospital types have the highest win rates? Where do deals expand after initial purchase? Which segments churn and why? Your historical data contains these answers, but extracting them requires analysis most teams don't have time for.</p>

        <h3>Healthcare buying is complex</h3>
        <p>Long sales cycles, multiple stakeholders, budget cycles tied to fiscal years. A deal that looks promising can stall for 18 months. Understanding which deals actually close—and why—requires looking at patterns across hundreds of opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Segments behave very differently</h3>
        <p>Academic medical centers buy differently than community hospitals. Health systems have different approval processes than independent facilities. Ambulatory centers have different budget constraints than acute care. One-size-fits-all targeting wastes resources.</p>

        <h3>The consolidation factor</h3>
        <p>As hospitals join health systems, purchasing decisions centralize. The independent hospital that was your perfect customer might now require system-level approval. Understanding how consolidation affects your ICP is critical.</p>

        <h2>What Healthcare Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not dashboards—recommendations you can act on.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Segment</h3>
        <p>Which healthcare organization types are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across segments to identify where you should focus.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Community hospitals with 100-250 beds have 3x higher LTV than larger academic centers, despite smaller initial deals. They expand faster and churn less."</p>

        <h3>Win/Loss Pattern Analysis</h3>
        <p>What separates deals that close from those that stall? We look at organization characteristics, buying committee composition, competitive presence, and timing to find predictive patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Deals involving the CMIO close at 2x the rate of CIO-only deals. Clinical champion involvement is a stronger predictor than budget size."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Churn Indicators</h3>
        <p>Which customers expand after initial purchase? Which churn? We identify the characteristics and behaviors that predict post-sale trajectory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers who implement within 60 days have 40% higher expansion rates. Delayed implementations correlate strongly with eventual churn."</p>

        <h3>Resource Allocation Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Based on the analysis, we provide specific recommendations for where to focus marketing spend, sales effort, and customer success resources.</p>
        <p><strong>Example output:</strong> "Shift 30% of marketing budget from large health systems to mid-size community hospitals. Expected impact: 25% improvement in marketing-attributed pipeline."</p>

        <h2>Healthcare-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Organization type.</strong> Academic medical centers, community hospitals, critical access hospitals, health systems, ambulatory surgery centers, physician practices. Each has distinct buying patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Bed count and facility size.</strong> Does size correlate with success? Often the relationship isn't linear—mid-size facilities may outperform both small and large.</li>

          <li><strong>Health system affiliation.</strong> Independent vs. system-owned. System purchasing dynamics differ significantly from independent facilities.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic patterns.</strong> Regional variations in buying behavior, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> EHR platform (Epic, Cerner, Meditech, etc.) often correlates with buying behavior and integration complexity.</li>

          <li><strong>Buying committee composition.</strong> Which stakeholders are involved? Clinical vs. IT vs. administrative leadership patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your healthcare market, current segmentation approach, and the questions you're trying to answer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions, looking for patterns that predict success. Healthcare-specific factors like organization type and affiliation are central to the analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to prioritize, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring adjustments, and resource allocation changes.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What healthcare data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your healthcare sales data to identify your ideal customer profile, segment accounts by likelihood to buy and expand, predict churn, and find patterns in win/loss data. The output is actionable recommendations for targeting and resource allocation.</p>

          <h3>How much healthcare sales data do you need?</h3>
          <p>Ideally 6+ months of customer data and 100+ closed deals with healthcare organizations. We can work with less, but insights will be directional rather than statistically significant.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze health system vs. independent hospital performance?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We frequently help companies understand whether their ICP skews toward large health systems, community hospitals, academic medical centers, or physician practices. This segmentation drives major differences in sales motion and resource allocation.</p>

          <h3>What if our data is messy?</h3>
          <p>Most healthcare sales data is. We can clean and enrich your data before analysis, or recommend doing so if data quality issues would compromise the analysis.</p>
