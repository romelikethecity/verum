        <h2>The Cybersecurity Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling security solutions. You know your target accounts. But your CRM has company names and maybe a main phone number. That's not enough to break through to security leaders who are drowning in vendor outreach.</p>

        <p>Security buyers are hard to reach. CISOs are protective of their contact information. Security teams don't broadcast their tech stack. And the security tools a company uses determine whether your solution is even relevant. Without enriched data, your SDRs are flying blind.</p>

        <h3>Security leaders are hard to find</h3>
        <p>CISOs don't put their direct lines on company websites. Main office numbers go to gatekeepers. Generic security@ emails go to spam filters. Without verified direct contact data, you're not getting through to decision-makers.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack visibility is critical</h3>
        <p>If you're selling EDR, you need to know if they're running CrowdStrike or Carbon Black. If you're selling SIEM, you need to know if they're on Splunk or building on open source. Tech stack data determines fit and personalization, but companies don't advertise their security tools.</p>

        <h3>Security org structures vary wildly</h3>
        <p>Some companies have a CISO reporting to the CEO. Others have a VP of Security under the CIO. Some have distributed security responsibilities. You need to know who actually makes security decisions at each account.</p>

        <h3>Budget signals are invisible</h3>
        <p>Is that company actively evaluating security tools? Do they have budget? Are they growing their security team? Without these signals, you're reaching out to companies that might not be in market.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the data cybersecurity vendors need to identify, qualify, and engage security buyers.</p>

        <h3>Security leadership contacts</h3>
        <p>CISOs, CSOs, VP Security, security architects, security engineers. Verified work emails, direct phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles. We identify the actual security decision-makers, not just whoever has "security" in their title.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for security leadership.</p>

        <h3>Security tech stack</h3>
        <p>What SIEM do they run? EDR platform? IAM provider? Email security? We identify 200+ security-specific technologies so you can qualify fit, identify competitive displacement opportunities, and personalize outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Security tech stack data showing current tools in use across key categories.</p>

        <h3>Security maturity indicators</h3>
        <p>SOC2 certified? ISO 27001? HIPAA compliant? These compliance achievements indicate security budget and maturity. We identify companies with serious security programs versus those with minimal investment.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Compliance certifications and security maturity signals for prioritization.</p>

        <h3>Budget and growth signals</h3>
        <p>Recently hired a CISO? Adding security team members? Had a breach? These signals indicate active security investment and buying intent. We identify companies that are actively building security capabilities.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Hiring trends, news events, and signals of security investment.</p>

        <h3>Company firmographics</h3>
        <p>Employee count, revenue, industry, headquarters. The data points that determine deal size and sales motion. We pull from multiple sources and cross-reference for accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete company profiles for targeting and segmentation.</p>

        <h2>What Cybersecurity Vendors Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Identify competitive displacement opportunities.</strong> Know who's running your competitor's solution and when their contract might be up for renewal.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize with tech stack context.</strong> "I see you're running Splunk" opens more conversations than generic security pitches.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize by security maturity.</strong> Focus on companies with SOC2 and active security investment, not those with minimal programs.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach actual decision-makers.</strong> Direct CISO contact data means you're not wasting time with gatekeepers.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With multiple security contacts at each account, you can engage the CISO and security architects simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Company names, target accounts, whatever you have. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> CISO contacts? Tech stack? Compliance data? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What security tech stack data can you provide?</h3>
          <p>We identify security tools companies are using: SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel), EDR (CrowdStrike, Carbon Black), IAM (Okta, Azure AD), firewalls, VPN, email security, and more. We detect 200+ security-specific technologies through web scanning, job postings, and proprietary signals.</p>

          <h3>Can you find CISO contact information?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We identify and provide verified contact data for CISOs, CSOs, VP Security, security architects, and other security leadership. Direct emails, phone numbers where available, and LinkedIn profiles. We also identify when a company doesn't have a CISO and who handles security in their absence.</p>

          <h3>How do you identify companies with security budget?</h3>
          <p>We look at multiple signals: recent security hires, compliance requirements (SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA), industry regulations, company size, and tech stack indicators. A company hiring a CISO or recently achieving SOC2 compliance likely has active security budget.</p>

          <h3>What's your coverage for mid-market companies?</h3>
          <p>Mid-market is our sweet spot for security contacts. Large enterprises have easily findable CISOs but complex buying processes. Mid-market companies (500-5000 employees) often have security leadership but less public profiles. We typically achieve 75-85% enrichment rates for this segment.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from ZoomInfo?</h3>
          <p>We enrich your existing accounts rather than selling a database. Our security tech stack coverage is deeper. And pricing is per-project, not $15K-50K annually. We're improving data you already have context on.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Enrich Your Security Data?</h2>

        <p><strong>Not sure what you're missing?</strong> Send us a sample list of 500 accounts. We'll analyze free and show you what we can enrich.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to enrich?</strong> Most projects start same-day. You'll have enriched data back in 24-48 hours.</p>
