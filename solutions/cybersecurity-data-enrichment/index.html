        <h2>The Cybersecurity Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's Monday morning. Your sales team has a list of 100 security directors to call this week. These are qualified leads. Companies that downloaded your whitepaper on ransomware prevention, attended your webinar on zero trust, requested demos that never happened.</p>

        <p>First twenty calls: four people who left the company, three who moved to different roles, two disconnected numbers, five voicemails to people who aren't in security anymore, and six actual conversations. Two of those six say they already implemented a competing solution while waiting for your follow-up.</p>

        <p>In a market where every CISO gets 50 vendor emails a day, you can't afford to waste time on dead data.</p>

        <h3>Security buyers move faster than your data</h3>
        <p>The average CISO tenure is about 26 months. Security directors change jobs constantly. The contact you met at RSA last year? There's a good chance they're somewhere else now. B2B contact data decays at roughly 25% per year, and in cybersecurity, that number trends higher. The people with budget authority tend to be highly mobile.</p>

        <h3>Technical sales cycles leave no room for waste</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity deals are complex. POCs, security reviews, compliance checks, procurement hurdles. The average B2B sales cycle runs 84 days, and security products often take longer. When your cycle is that long, you can't afford to spend weeks nurturing a contact who left. Every bad data point delays revenue.</p>

        <h3>Your SDRs are researchers, not sellers</h3>
        <p>Research shows sales reps spend only 30% of their time actually selling. The rest goes to data entry, research, internal meetings, and administrative work. In cybersecurity, where you need to understand each prospect's tech stack, compliance requirements, and security posture, that research burden is even heavier.</p>

        <h3>Conference leads decay fastest</h3>
        <p>You spent $50K on that RSA booth. You collected 500 badge scans. Six months later, half of those contacts have changed jobs or emails. The ROI on conference spend depends entirely on how fast you can work those leads with clean data.</p>

        <p>Every wrong phone number is a missed opportunity. Every bounced email is a competitor who got there first. Your team deserves better than a CRM full of decay.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Cybersecurity Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a full-time data analyst just to keep your CRM usable. Verum takes the decaying, incomplete, outdated data across your systems and makes it work. We cross-reference multiple sources, verify contacts, and fill in gaps. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. When a CISO moves from one company to another, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For cybersecurity teams:</strong> Stop calling people who left. Know when your champion moves to a new company and might need your solution there too. Follow the relationship.</p>

        <h3>Technographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing tech stack data? We can append information about security tools in use, cloud infrastructure, and technology signals. Know who's running legacy firewalls, who just moved to the cloud, who's using your competitors.</p>
        <p><strong>For cybersecurity teams:</strong> Personalize outreach based on actual stack. Prioritize prospects with technology gaps you can fill. Skip the ones who just bought from a competitor.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Completion</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Industry classification? Compliance requirements? We fill in the gaps so your segmentation actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>For cybersecurity teams:</strong> Know which prospects are in regulated industries that need your compliance features. Know who's big enough to need enterprise security. Prioritize by actual fit.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Cybersecurity titles are inconsistent. VP of Security at one company is Director of InfoSec at another. We normalize and verify.</p>

        <h2>What Cybersecurity Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Maximize conference ROI.</strong> Clean those badge scans within 48 hours of returning from RSA, Black Hat, or regional events. Follow up while the memory is fresh.</li>

          <li><strong>Track champion mobility.</strong> When your biggest advocate moves to a new company, that's a warm lead. Clean data lets you follow those relationships instead of losing them.</li>

          <li><strong>Personalize technical outreach.</strong> With accurate tech stack data, your SDRs can reference actual tools in use instead of generic "security challenges."</li>

          <li><strong>Prioritize by compliance need.</strong> Know which prospects are in healthcare, finance, or other regulated industries that need specific compliance features.</li>

          <li><strong>Shorten effective sales cycles.</strong> When you're not wasting weeks on dead contacts, your real cycle compresses. More time with actual buyers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? HubSpot? Outreach? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 25% annual decay and high CISO mobility, cybersecurity data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Why Cybersecurity Leaders Choose Verum</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>We do the work.</strong> This isn't another platform for your team to learn. Send us your data, get clean data back. Your SDRs stay focused on selling.</li>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Get those conference leads cleaned before the momentum dies.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Every project gets both.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Clean your data before RSA, pay for that project. That's it.</li>

          <li><strong>We understand security.</strong> The difference between a CISO and a CSO. InfoSec vs IT. Compliance vs security operations. We know the domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About Cybersecurity Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich technographic data for security stack?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can append information about security tools in use, compliance certifications, and technology infrastructure. Know which prospects use your competitors, which have specific compliance requirements, and which have security gaps you can address.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with our sales engagement platform?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, SalesLoft, Apollo, and most other platforms used by cybersecurity vendors. If your system can export data, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new CISO names, that's their strength. But if you already have thousands of contacts from conferences, inbound leads, and years of outbound, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your conference leads, pay for that project. No ongoing fees.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand that security vendors have their own security requirements. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific protocols.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with cybersecurity startups and public companies. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A CRM with 5,000 contacts has the same decay issues as one with 500,000.</p>
