        <h2>The Insurance Market Targeting Challenge</h2>

        <p>Insurance is a massive, complex market. National carriers with decades-old legacy systems. Regional mutuals with local focus. MGAs and MGUs disrupting specialty lines. Insurtechs challenging traditional models. They all buy technology and services, but their paths to purchase differ dramatically.</p>

        <p>Most vendors segment by carrier size or premium volume. But a regional P&C carrier and a regional life insurer of similar size have completely different technology needs and buying processes. Lines of business often predict behavior better than overall scale.</p>

        <p>Which lines of business close fastest? Do carriers with captive agents buy differently than those using independent brokers? Where does digital transformation budget actually sit? Your deal history contains the patterns.</p>

        <h3>Lines of business drive everything</h3>
        <p>P&C, life, health, and specialty lines operate as almost separate industries. They have different regulatory requirements, different technology stacks, different distribution channels. Treating them as one "insurance" market misses the segmentation that matters.</p>

        <h3>Distribution model shapes buying behavior</h3>
        <p>Carriers with captive agent forces have different technology priorities than those relying on independent agents or direct-to-consumer models. The distribution strategy affects not just what they buy but how they buy it.</p>

        <h3>Legacy systems create both pain and friction</h3>
        <p>Insurance runs on legacy technology. Core systems from the 1980s. Manual processes everywhere. This creates massive pain that drives buying, but also implementation complexity that slows decisions. Understanding which carriers can actually adopt new technology is crucial.</p>

        <h2>What Insurance Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not theoretical frameworks. Insights that change how you target and sell.</p>

        <h3>ICP by Lines of Business</h3>
        <p>Which insurance lines drive your best outcomes? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, and expansion across P&C, life, health, and specialty segments.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "P&C carriers close at 2x the rate of life insurers, with 40% shorter cycles. But life deals expand 3x more over time. Different segments need different sales motions."</p>

        <h3>Distribution Model Analysis</h3>
        <p>How does distribution strategy affect buying behavior? We analyze patterns across captive, independent, and direct channels.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Carriers with 70%+ independent agent distribution close 50% faster than captive-heavy carriers. Less internal politics, faster procurement. But captive carriers have 2x the budget."</p>

        <h3>Carrier Size and Type Patterns</h3>
        <p>National carriers, regional carriers, mutuals, stock companies, captives. Each has different decision structures and buying behaviors.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Regional mutuals in the $500M&#8209;$2B premium range have the best LTV/effort ratio. Large enough to have budget, small enough to make decisions. Nationals take 3x longer."</p>

        <h3>Technology Maturity Correlation</h3>
        <p>Some carriers are modernizing aggressively. Others are managing legacy indefinitely. We identify which modernization patterns predict buying behavior.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Carriers who've replaced core systems in the last 5 years close at 3x the rate. Recent modernization signals appetite for change and budget availability."</p>

        <h2>Insurance-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Lines of business.</strong> P&C (personal, commercial), life and annuities, health, specialty/surplus. Each line has distinct technology needs and buying patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Distribution model.</strong> Captive agents, independent agents, brokers, direct-to-consumer, bancassurance. Distribution strategy shapes technology priorities.</li>

          <li><strong>Carrier type and structure.</strong> Stock companies, mutuals, reciprocals, captives, RRGs. Ownership structure affects decision-making speed and budget processes.</li>

          <li><strong>Premium volume and market position.</strong> Top 25 national, regional leaders, niche specialists. Size correlates with complexity but not always with opportunity.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic footprint.</strong> National, multi-state regional, single-state. Footprint affects regulatory complexity and technology needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology maturity.</strong> Core system age, cloud adoption, API readiness. Modernization stage predicts buying behavior and implementation success.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your insurance market focus, current segmentation, and the questions you need answered.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We assess what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions. Lines of business and distribution model interactions are often the most revealing cuts.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to prioritize, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict wins.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring, and go-to-market adjustments.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What insurance data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your sales data to identify which carrier types, lines of business, and distribution models correlate with success. Output includes ICP recommendations, win/loss patterns by carrier tier, and resource allocation guidance for selling to insurance companies.</p>

          <h3>How do you segment insurance companies for analysis?</h3>
          <p>We analyze by lines of business (P&C, life, health, specialty), carrier size and type (national, regional, mutual, captive), distribution model (direct, agency, broker), and technology maturity. These dimensions reveal very different buying behaviors.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze captive vs. independent agent distribution patterns?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Distribution model significantly affects technology needs and buying behavior. Carriers with captive agents have different priorities than those relying on independent brokers. We identify which distribution models correlate with your best outcomes.</p>

          <h3>What about MGAs and brokers?</h3>
          <p>We analyze MGAs, MGUs, wholesalers, and retail brokers as distinct segments. Each has different economics, technology needs, and decision-making patterns compared to carriers.</p>
