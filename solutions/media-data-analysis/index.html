        <h2>The Media Revenue Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Media companies generate massive amounts of data—audience metrics, advertiser spend, content performance, engagement signals. But translating that data into revenue strategy is increasingly complex. Distribution is fragmenting. Attention is scarce. Advertisers have more options than ever.</p>

        <p>Most media sales teams segment advertisers by spend level or industry vertical. But these broad categories miss the patterns that predict advertiser success. A retail brand spending $50K might have more growth potential than an auto brand spending $500K.</p>

        <h3>Content type affects advertiser fit</h3>
        <p>Some advertisers thrive with news content. Others perform better with entertainment or sports. Understanding which content types drive results for which advertiser categories helps you sell more effectively and retain accounts.</p>

        <h3>Distribution models are converging</h3>
        <p>Streaming, linear, digital, print—most media companies now operate across multiple channels. Understanding how advertisers perform across distribution models reveals where to focus sales effort and pricing strategy.</p>

        <h3>The agency relationship factor</h3>
        <p>Media sales often flow through agencies with high turnover. Understanding direct vs. agency relationships, and which agency contacts drive decisions, is critical for stable revenue growth.</p>

        <h3>Audience composition drives value</h3>
        <p>Not all impressions are equal. Which audience segments command premium pricing? Where do advertisers see the best ROI? The data exists, but extracting insights requires analysis most teams don't have time for.</p>

        <h2>What Media Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <h3>Advertiser Segmentation by Performance</h3>
        <p>Which advertiser categories have the highest retention? Best renewal rates? Strongest expansion patterns? We analyze across industry vertical, spend level, and campaign type.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "DTC brands in the $100K-500K range have 2.5x better retention than Fortune 500 advertisers at similar spend. They expand faster and negotiate less on pricing."</p>

        <h3>Content Performance Correlation</h3>
        <p>Which content types drive advertiser success? We analyze how content category, format, and audience composition affect campaign outcomes and advertiser satisfaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Advertisers on premium entertainment content renew at 85% vs. 62% for news. The CPM premium is justified by performance—consider rebalancing sales focus."</p>

        <h3>Distribution Model Analysis</h3>
        <p>How do advertisers perform across streaming, linear, digital, and other channels? We identify where to prioritize inventory and how to bundle offerings.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Cross-platform advertisers (streaming + linear) have 3x higher LTV than single-channel buyers. Bundle pricing is leaving money on the table."</p>

        <h3>Revenue Concentration and Risk</h3>
        <p>How concentrated is your revenue across advertisers, agencies, and categories? We identify concentration risks and diversification opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Your top 5 agency relationships represent 45% of revenue with average 18-month tenure. Prioritize relationship depth over new agency prospecting."</p>
