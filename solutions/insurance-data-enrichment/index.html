        <h2>The Insurance Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's renewal season. Your agency has 3,000 policies coming up in the next 60 days. You need to reach every one of those clients, confirm coverage needs haven't changed, and prevent them from shopping around.</p>

        <p>Your producer pulls the list. First 50 calls: eight disconnected numbers, twelve voicemails to addresses that sound wrong, six people who say they already talked to someone else at your agency, and maybe fifteen actual conversations. Some of those conversations reveal the client moved to a new state six months ago and their policy doesn't even apply anymore.</p>

        <p>The data exists. It's just scattered, duplicated, and decaying faster than anyone can fix it manually.</p>

        <h3>AI adoption is up, but data quality isn't</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.decerto.com/post/future-trends-in-insurance-crm-ai-automation-and-predictive-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conning research</a>, 77% of insurance companies now use AI in their operations, up from 61% the year before. Chatbots handle 70% of routine inquiries. Predictive analytics drive underwriting decisions. But all of that sophistication falls apart when the underlying contact data is wrong.</p>

        <h3>Duplicate records cost real money</h3>
        <p>Operational inefficiencies from data errors cost insurers millions annually. Duplicate policyholder records, incorrect addresses, outdated phone numbers. Each error creates manual work, delays claims, or sends renewal notices into the void. The Coalition of Insurance Fraud estimates $80 billion is lost annually to fraudulent claims alone, and poor data quality makes detection harder.</p>

        <h3>Agent data fragmentation is endemic</h3>
        <p>Insurance agents struggle to compile data from different sources. Your agency management system has one version of the truth. Your quoting platform has another. Your marketing automation tool has a third. Getting a complete picture of a client relationship means pulling data from multiple places and hoping it matches.</p>

        <h3>Retention depends on clean data</h3>
        <p>According to McKinsey, satisfied policyholders are 80% more likely to renew. But you can't satisfy a policyholder if you can't reach them. Research shows CRM adoption improves customer retention by 27%, but only when the data in the CRM is actually accurate.</p>

        <p>Every wrong phone number is a missed renewal call. Every bounced email is a client who might shop around without you knowing. Your producers deserve better than spending half their day verifying contact information.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Insurance Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a dedicated data analyst just to keep your agency management system usable. Verum takes the duplicated, outdated, fragmented data across your systems and makes it work. We cross-reference multiple sources, merge records, and fill in gaps. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging address changes, updating phone numbers, and catching email bounces before they happen. When a policyholder moves, we know.</p>
        <p><strong>For insurance teams:</strong> Stop sending renewal notices to old addresses. Reach clients on their current phone numbers. Keep relationships intact even when people move.</p>

        <h3>Record Deduplication</h3>
        <p>"John Smith" and "J. Smith" at slightly different addresses? We figure out if it's the same person and merge the records. No more sending three copies of the same mailer or having three producers think they own the same account.</p>
        <p><strong>For insurance teams:</strong> See the complete picture of client relationships. Know every policy across personal and commercial lines in one view.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment for Commercial Lines</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Industry classification? We fill in the gaps so your commercial targeting actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>For insurance teams:</strong> Know which businesses are growing and might need additional coverage. Spot acquisition targets. Prioritize prospects that fit your appetite.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Insurance data has quirks. Named insureds with multiple DBAs. Commercial accounts with subsidiary structures. We catch what automated systems miss.</p>

        <h2>What Insurance Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Increase renewal contact rates by 40%+.</strong> When phone numbers work and emails land, your producers actually reach clients before they shop around.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce duplicate policy servicing.</strong> When records are merged correctly, you stop wasting time servicing the same client through multiple incomplete profiles.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve cross-sell success.</strong> Complete client views reveal gaps in coverage. Know who has auto but not home, commercial property but not liability.</li>

          <li><strong>Speed up onboarding for book acquisitions.</strong> When you acquire another agency's book, clean data integration takes days instead of months.</li>

          <li><strong>Support compliance with accurate records.</strong> Regulatory requirements get easier when you can trust your contact data is current and complete.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Applied Epic? Vertafore? HawkSoft? Agency Zoom? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 25% annual decay, insurance data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Insurance Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Do you handle regulated insurance data?</h3>
          <p>We work with contact and firmographic data, not claims or policy details. We clean your prospect and customer contact information, company data, and agent records. No PHI, no claims data, no underwriting files. If you need that level of data work, you need a different kind of vendor.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with our agency management system?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Applied Epic, Vertafore AMS360, HawkSoft, Agency Zoom, and most other systems. If your platform can export data, we can clean it. If you want cleaned data pushed back in, we can work with your IT team on that.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new commercial prospects, that's their strength. But if you already have years of policyholder and prospect data, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh before renewal season? Pay for that refresh.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand insurance industry security requirements. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific compliance needs.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with agencies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with independent agents, large agencies, and national carriers. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A book of 1,000 clients has the same decay issues as one with 100,000.</p>
