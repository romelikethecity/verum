        <h2>The Nonprofit Prospect Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're running development operations for a nonprofit. Your CRM has donor names and giving history. But you're missing the data you need to identify major gift prospects and cultivate them effectively.</p>

        <p>Prospect research is time-consuming. Your development team spends hours researching individual donors instead of building relationships. Meanwhile, hidden major gift prospects sit in your database unidentified because you lack the capacity indicators and wealth data to find them.</p>

        <h3>Capacity is hidden</h3>
        <p>Who among your donors has major gift potential? The data that indicates wealth, real estate ownership, business interests, and stock holdings isn't in your CRM. Your major gift officers don't know where to focus.</p>

        <h3>Employment data is outdated</h3>
        <p>Your donor records show employers from when they first gave. People change jobs, get promoted, and retire. Without current employment data, you can't identify matching gift eligibility or leverage corporate connections.</p>

        <h3>Philanthropic history is incomplete</h3>
        <p>Where else do your donors give? What causes do they support? Foundation board memberships? Philanthropic history indicates giving capacity and affinity, but you don't have this data across your donor base.</p>

        <h3>Foundation data is fragmentary</h3>
        <p>For institutional fundraising, you need foundation giving history, focus areas, and current contacts. But this data is scattered across multiple sources and hard to aggregate.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the data that development teams need to identify, qualify, and cultivate donors effectively.</p>

        <h3>Contact information</h3>
        <p>Verified email addresses, phone numbers, and current mailing addresses for your donors. Development communications require deliverability. We ensure you can actually reach the people you're trying to cultivate.</p>

        <h3>Employment and professional data</h3>

        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Current employment data enabling capacity assessment and corporate connections.</p>

        <h3>Wealth indicators</h3>
        <p>Real estate ownership, business interests, stock holdings in public companies, and other publicly available wealth indicators. These signals help identify major gift potential in your existing donor base.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Capacity indicators enabling major gift prospect identification.</p>

        <h3>Philanthropic giving history</h3>
        <p>Foundation board memberships, other nonprofit board roles, and charitable giving history where publicly disclosed. Understanding donor philanthropic activity helps with cultivation and ask strategies.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Giving history data indicating donor priorities and capacity.</p>

        <h2>What Development Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Identify hidden major gift prospects.</strong> Wealth indicators reveal donors with capacity you didn't know about. Mid-level donors become major gift prospects.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize cultivation efforts.</strong> Capacity and affinity data helps you focus major gift officer time on the prospects most likely to give.</li>
          <li><strong>Leverage corporate connections.</strong> Current employment data identifies matching gift opportunities and corporate partnership possibilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve institutional fundraising.</strong> Foundation and corporate data helps you target the right funders with relevant proposals.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach donors effectively.</strong> Validated contact data means your cultivation communications actually reach your prospects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Donor names, constituent records, whatever data you have. We work with exports from nonprofit CRMs and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Contact validation? Wealth indicators? Employment data? Foundation research? We customize enrichment to your development priorities.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your development team starts working with enhanced prospect data immediately.</p>

          <p>We enrich donor records with verified contact information, employment data, and capacity indicators. For individuals, we provide employer, title, and wealth data. For organizations, we verify contacts and provide firmographics.</p>

          <h3>Can you provide wealth screening data?</h3>

          <h3>How is this different from traditional prospect research?</h3>

          <h3>Do you work with nonprofit-specific CRMs?</h3>
