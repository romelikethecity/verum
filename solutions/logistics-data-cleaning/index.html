        <h2>The Logistics Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're running a brokerage, carrier, or shipping operation. Your TMS and CRM hold years of carrier relationships, shipper accounts, and lane history. But that data has become fragmented and unreliable.</p>

        <p>Logistics has unique data challenges. Carriers operate under different DBAs. Owner-operators get acquired by larger fleets. Operating authority changes. Contacts at shippers turn over frequently. And every new load adds records that may duplicate existing relationships.</p>

        <h3>Carriers are duplicated everywhere</h3>
        <p>"ABC Trucking" and "ABC Transport LLC" and "ABC Logistics" might all be the same carrier. Or they might be different companies. When you're booking loads, you can't easily see a carrier's full lane history because it's scattered across duplicate records.</p>

        <h3>Contacts are constantly moving</h3>
        <p>The dispatcher you worked with last quarter moved to another carrier. The shipper's logistics manager changed companies. Freight is a high-turnover industry, and every job change creates stale contact data.</p>

        <h3>Authority and insurance data is stale</h3>
        <p>Operating authority changes. Insurance certificates expire. Your approved carrier list shows credentials that were current months ago. Compliance requirements mean you need current data, but manual verification is time-consuming.</p>

        <h3>Shipper data is inconsistent</h3>
        <p>The same shipper might appear under corporate name, division name, and facility-specific entries. Location data is scattered. Your account-level view of shipper relationships is fragmented.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Logistics Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the specific challenges of logistics data. Carrier relationships that span years. Operating authority that needs verification. The importance of accurate lane and capacity data.</p>

        <h3>Carrier deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match carrier records across company names, MC numbers, DOT numbers, and contact patterns. We understand that carriers operate under multiple names. We consolidate duplicates while preserving complete lane history and performance data.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per carrier with complete history, plus merge logs showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses and phone numbers for carrier dispatchers, shipper logistics contacts, and key relationships. Logistics communications require reliability. We flag contacts who've moved and identify current information.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated contacts, with job change flags for relationship continuity.</p>

        <h3>Authority and compliance flagging</h3>
        <p>We flag carriers with authority issues, expired insurance, or safety concerns based on publicly available FMCSA data. This helps you maintain compliant carrier lists without manual verification of every carrier.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Compliance flags enabling quick identification of carriers needing verification.</p>

        <h3>Shipper standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize shipper company names, location data, and account structures. Your shipper relationships are organized consistently, enabling accurate account-level analysis and relationship management.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent shipper records enabling accurate account management and revenue analysis.</p>

        <h2>What Logistics Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>See true carrier capacity.</strong> Consolidated records show each carrier's complete lane history and performance, enabling better capacity planning.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain compliance.</strong> Clean authority and insurance data means your approved carrier lists meet regulatory requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach the right people.</strong> Current contact data means your load opportunities and communications reach active dispatchers and logistics contacts.</li>
          <li><strong>Understand shipper relationships.</strong> Clean shipper data shows true account value and enables strategic account management.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your analytics.</strong> Clean data means your lane performance and carrier metrics reflect reality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull carrier, shipper, and contact data from your TMS or CRM. We work with exports from major TMS platforms and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, stale contacts, and compliance issues. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex carrier matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your operations team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>
