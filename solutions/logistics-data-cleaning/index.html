        <h2>The Logistics Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell technology, services, or capacity to the logistics industry. Your CRM contains shippers, carriers, 3PLs, freight brokers, and warehousing companies. But the logistics industry is volatile.</p>

        <p>That trucking company you've been pursuing? Went out of business during the freight recession. The 3PL you built a relationship with? Acquired by a larger player. The supply chain director on your target list? Moved to a competitor. Your database reflects a logistics landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Logistics data has unique challenges. Carrier turnover, constant M&A, and the cyclical nature of the freight market mean your prospect data ages faster than you'd expect.</p>

        <h3>Carrier volatility is extreme</h3>
        <p>Trucking companies enter and exit the market constantly. Small carriers go out of business. Others grow rapidly through acquisition. Your carrier database includes companies that no longer operate and misses new entrants that should be targets.</p>

        <h3>3PL and broker consolidation continues</h3>
        <p>PE firms continue rolling up freight brokers and 3PLs. Independent brokerages join larger platforms. Your target account list includes companies that no longer exist independently. Decision-making shifts to new corporate structures.</p>

        <h3>Supply chain contacts move frequently</h3>
        <p>VP of Supply Chain, Director of Logistics, Transportation Manager—these roles are in high demand and turn over frequently. The decision-maker you've been nurturing might be at a different company than your CRM shows.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought shipper databases, carrier lists, 3PL directories. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different levels of accuracy. Now you have the same company five times with conflicting information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for logistics sales. When market conditions are tough, you can't afford to waste time pursuing companies that closed or contacts who moved.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Logistics Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy logistics database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that companies are still operating, flag those that have gone out of business or been acquired, and update records where we can identify successor companies.</p>
        <p><strong>For logistics sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing carriers that closed. Know when targets have been acquired. Focus on companies that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names vary (doing business as, MC numbers, etc.) or data came from different sources.</p>
        <p><strong>For logistics sales teams:</strong> One clean record per company. Handle carrier name variations and DBA distinctions. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Moves and departures get flagged.</p>
        <p><strong>For logistics sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current companies. Know when contacts move. Maintain relationships across job changes.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, types (shipper, carrier, 3PL, broker), and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For logistics sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by company type. Target asset-based carriers vs. brokers differently. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Logistics Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on active companies.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on carriers that went out of business or 3PLs that were acquired. Every account in your database represents a real company that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track contact moves.</strong> When decision-makers move between companies, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people change employers within logistics.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by company type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target shippers differently from carriers, asset-based companies differently from brokers. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Handle carrier complexity.</strong> DBA names, MC numbers, parent-subsidiary relationships. Clean data clarifies who you're actually targeting.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of what cleaning can realistically accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your data sources and target segments. Shippers? Carriers? 3PLs? We've worked with all types of logistics data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your logistics database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Logistics data goes stale fast given market volatility. We can run quarterly cleaning. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Logistics Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of logistics data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Shipper databases, carrier contact lists, 3PL and freight broker data, supply chain executive contacts, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the logistics and transportation industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you track carrier and 3PL acquisitions?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate company names against current data and can flag records where companies have merged or been acquired. This is valuable given the ongoing consolidation in freight and logistics.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle carrier DBA names and MC numbers?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can help reconcile different naming conventions and handle the complexity of carriers operating under multiple DBAs or through subsidiary structures.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our logistics data?</h3>
          <p>Given the volatility in freight and logistics, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant market shifts.</p>
