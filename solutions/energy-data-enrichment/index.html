        <h2>The Energy Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's Q4 planning. Your sales team is building their target account list for the year. Utilities with infrastructure projects. Oil and gas companies evaluating new technology. Clean energy firms expanding operations. The TAM looks massive.</p>

        <p>Then reality hits. That utility you've been nurturing for two years? They merged with a regional competitor. The VP of Operations you had a relationship with? She retired. The contact at the renewable energy startup? They pivoted to a different market. Your carefully built pipeline is full of ghosts and outdated org charts.</p>

        <p>The energy sector is transforming faster than most CRMs can keep up.</p>

        <h3>Industry consolidation reshapes your market constantly</h3>
        <p>Utilities merge. Independent power producers get acquired. Oil and gas companies consolidate. The energy transition is driving M&A activity at rates not seen in decades. Your target account from last quarter might now be a subsidiary of someone else. The buyer you knew might report to entirely new leadership.</p>

        <h3>Long sales cycles make data decay worse</h3>
        <p>Energy deals take time. Capital expenditure decisions go through multiple budget cycles. That 18-month sales cycle you're navigating? In that time, 30-40% of your contacts will have changed roles, companies, or retired entirely. The champion you cultivated might not be there when the deal finally comes together.</p>

        <h3>The energy transition creates new buyers constantly</h3>
        <p>Clean energy, grid modernization, electrification. New roles are being created at utilities and energy companies that didn't exist five years ago. VP of Sustainability. Director of Grid Innovation. Chief Decarbonization Officer. Your existing buyer data doesn't include the people now making decisions about your technology.</p>

        <h3>Regulatory complexity fragments your market</h3>
        <p>Different rules in different regions. Deregulated versus regulated markets. IOUs versus munis versus co-ops. The same job title means different things at different types of utilities. Generic B2B data providers don't understand these distinctions. Your targeting suffers.</p>

        <p>Every outdated contact is a conversation that never happens. Every missed merger is an account that slips away. Every new buyer you don't know about is a deal that goes to a competitor. In an industry measured in decades-long infrastructure investments, you can't afford to be working from yesterday's data.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Energy Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a research team to know which utilities merged last quarter. Verum takes your prospect databases, your CRM exports, and your account lists, and makes them current. We track corporate changes, verify contacts, and enrich records. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging role changes, updating titles, and verifying current employers. We catch the decay before your sales team wastes time on outdated leads.</p>
        <p><strong>For energy teams:</strong> Know when your champion moves to a new utility. Stop emailing people who retired two years ago.</p>

        <h3>Corporate Change Tracking</h3>
        <p>Mergers, acquisitions, name changes, subsidiary restructuring. We update your account records to reflect current corporate reality. Know who owns what and who reports to whom.</p>
        <p><strong>For energy teams:</strong> Stop pitching accounts that no longer exist. Understand the new decision-making structure after a merger.</p>

        <h3>Buyer Intelligence Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company details? Utility type? Service territory? We append the firmographic data that makes targeting work. Know which utilities are investing in grid modernization versus which are in maintenance mode.</p>
        <p><strong>For energy teams:</strong> Prioritize accounts by investment patterns. Focus on utilities with active capital programs.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before delivery. Energy data has complexity. Holding companies versus operating companies. Regulated versus merchant generation. We catch what algorithms miss.</p>

        <h2>What Energy Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Build pipeline that reflects current market structure.</strong> When your account data is accurate, you're not wasting time on merged entities or obsolete org structures. Your targeting actually matches today's energy landscape.</li>

          <li><strong>Track decision-makers across the industry.</strong> When your champion moves to a new utility, that's a warm lead at a new account. Clean data lets you follow relationships as people move.</li>

          <li><strong>Identify new buyer roles proactively.</strong> The energy transition is creating new titles and new decision-makers. We help you find the sustainability leads and innovation directors your current data misses.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by utility type and investment activity.</strong> IOUs versus munis. Utilities with active rate cases versus those in holding patterns. Better segmentation means more relevant outreach.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce research time for account planning.</strong> Your AEs shouldn't spend hours researching whether that utility still exists in its original form. Get accurate account intelligence from day one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Energy markets shift constantly. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep pace with M&A and role changes. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Energy Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any system.</p>

          <h3>Can you track utility mergers and acquisitions?</h3>
          <p>Yes. The energy sector has seen significant M&A activity. We track corporate changes, identify successor companies, and update contact information so your outreach doesn't go to companies that no longer exist in their original form.</p>

          <h3>Do you cover both traditional and renewable energy?</h3>
          <p>We work across the energy spectrum. Utilities, oil and gas, renewable developers, energy storage, grid technology. If they're in the energy value chain, we can clean and enrich your data on them.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of energy sector relationships and that data is stale? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before the utility conference, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We understand your prospect list is competitive intelligence. We treat it accordingly.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with energy startups and Fortune 500 utilities. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of scale. A prospect database with 500 accounts has the same decay issues as one with 50,000.</p>
