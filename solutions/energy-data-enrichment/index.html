        <h2>The Energy Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to utilities, oil & gas companies, and renewable energy developers. These are complex organizations with long sales cycles. You can't afford to waste time on incomplete data or wrong contacts.</p>

        <p>Energy buyer data has unique challenges. Utilities are regulated entities with complex procurement processes. Oil & gas companies have distributed operations teams. Renewable developers are private and hard to research. And the firmographic data that determines fit, like generation capacity and service territory, isn't readily available in standard databases.</p>

        <h3>Operations contacts are protected</h3>
        <p>Utility operations teams don't put their direct lines on company websites. Oil & gas field operations are even more protected. Without verified direct contact information, you're calling corporate switchboards and hoping for the best.</p>

        <h3>Buying committees are complex</h3>
        <p>A utility technology purchase might involve operations, engineering, IT, procurement, and regulatory affairs. You need the full buying committee, not just a single contact. And you need to understand who drives decisions versus who approves budget.</p>

        <h3>Utility metrics matter for qualification</h3>
        <p>A utility with 5 million customers has different needs than a municipal utility with 50,000. Generation capacity, service territory, and customer mix determine fit. This data exists in regulatory filings but isn't easy to compile.</p>

        <h3>Investment priorities vary</h3>
        <p>Is the utility focused on grid modernization? Renewable integration? Distribution automation? Their investment priorities determine your positioning. But these priorities are scattered across rate cases, investor presentations, and press releases.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that energy sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage utilities and energy companies.</p>

        <h3>Operations and engineering contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for energy decision-makers. VPs of Operations, Engineering Directors, IT leadership, Grid Modernization leads, and Sustainability executives. The people who buy energy technology.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for energy contacts.</p>

        <h3>Buying committee mapping</h3>
        <p>We identify both technical evaluators and executives who approve purchases. Operations, engineering, IT, procurement, and regulatory affairs stakeholders.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multi-contact enrichment showing the full buying committee at target companies.</p>

        <h3>Utility firmographics</h3>
        <p>Customer counts, generation capacity, service territory, rate base, and ownership structure. The metrics from regulatory filings that determine utility size and potential deal size.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firmographic profiles for target utilities from public sources.</p>

        <h3>Investment and initiative data</h3>
        <p>Grid modernization programs, renewable energy targets, distribution automation initiatives. We compile investment priorities from rate cases, press releases, and regulatory filings.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Investment signals for positioning and timing outreach.</p>

        <h3>Segment classification</h3>
        <p>Investor-owned utilities, municipals, cooperatives, oil & gas (upstream, midstream, downstream), renewable developers, IPPs. Clear classification enables targeted campaigns.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Segment classification for precise targeting.</p>

        <h2>What Energy Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach operations directly.</strong> With verified contact info for operations and engineering leadership, you connect with decision-makers instead of corporate gatekeepers.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by utility size.</strong> Customer count and capacity data lets you instantly qualify whether a utility is in your target tier.</li>
          <li><strong>Position to investment priorities.</strong> Initiative data helps you position your solution to their active programs and budget cycles.</li>
          <li><strong>Segment by utility type.</strong> Classification data lets you run targeted campaigns to IOUs vs municipals vs cooperatives.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread across functions.</strong> With the full buying committee mapped, your reps engage operations, IT, and procurement simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Utility names, energy companies, whatever accounts you're targeting. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Operations contacts? Full buying committee? Firmographics? Initiative data? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources including regulatory filings, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>
