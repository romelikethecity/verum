        <h2>The Education Market Targeting Challenge</h2>

        <p>Education spans a remarkable range. Elite R1 research universities with billion-dollar endowments. Rural community colleges serving working adults. Urban K-12 districts with complex politics. Charter networks disrupting traditional models. They all need technology and services, but they buy in completely different ways.</p>

        <p>Most edtech companies segment by institution type and enrollment size. But a 5,000-student regional comprehensive university and a 5,000-student liberal arts college have almost nothing in common in terms of buying behavior. Carnegie classification, research focus, and institutional culture often predict outcomes better than raw enrollment.</p>

        <p>Which institution types close fastest? Do R1 universities expand better than teaching-focused colleges? Where does real budget authority sit in a state university system? Your deal history contains the patterns.</p>

        <h3>Budget cycles dominate everything</h3>
        <p>Education runs on annual and sometimes multi-year budget cycles. Miss the window and you're waiting 12 months. State appropriations, federal funding, tuition revenue, and endowment draws all follow different timelines. Understanding these cycles by institution type is essential.</p>

        <h3>K-12 and higher ed are different worlds</h3>
        <p>K-12 involves school boards, superintendents, and district-level decisions. Higher ed involves provosts, deans, and department chairs. The stakeholders, budget processes, and procurement rules have almost nothing in common. Treating them as one "education" market wastes resources.</p>

        <h3>Institution type matters more than size</h3>
        <p>A 2,000-student community college and a 2,000-student elite liberal arts college have similar enrollment but wildly different economics, priorities, and buying behavior. Carnegie classification and institutional mission often predict outcomes better than headcount.</p>

        <h2>What Education Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not enrollment counts. Insights that change how you allocate resources.</p>

        <h3>ICP by Institution Type</h3>
        <p>Which institution types are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion, and churn across K-12, community college, four-year, and graduate segments.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Community colleges close at 2x the rate of R1 universities, with 60% shorter cycles. Smaller deals but faster expansion and lower churn. R1s have bigger budgets but brutal procurement."</p>

        <h3>Carnegie Classification Analysis</h3>
        <p>For higher ed, Carnegie classification reveals institutional priorities. Research universities, masters institutions, baccalaureate colleges each have different needs and buying patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Masters-level comprehensive universities have the best LTV/effort ratio. More focused than R1s, more budget than liberal arts colleges. Sweet spot for mid-market deals."</p>

        <h3>Enrollment Size Correlation</h3>
        <p>Does enrollment size predict success? The relationship is often non-linear. We identify the enrollment bands where your solution performs best.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Institutions with 5,000&#8209;15,000 enrollment close at 3x the rate of 30,000+ mega-universities. Big enough to have budget, small enough to make decisions."</p>

        <h3>Public vs. Private Patterns</h3>
        <p>Public institutions face procurement rules and state oversight. Private institutions have different constraints. We analyze how ownership structure affects buying behavior.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Private institutions close 40% faster but expand 30% less. Public institutions take longer upfront but have better renewal and growth patterns."</p>

        <h2>Education-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Institution type.</strong> K-12 district, charter network, community college, four-year college, research university, graduate/professional school. Each operates on different economics.</li>

          <li><strong>Carnegie classification.</strong> R1, R2, masters comprehensive, baccalaureate, associates. Classification reveals institutional priorities and technology needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Enrollment size.</strong> Total students, FTE, online vs. on-campus. Size affects budget and complexity but the relationship isn't always linear.</li>

          <li><strong>Public vs. private.</strong> State flagship, regional public, elite private, religious-affiliated. Ownership affects procurement, budget cycles, and decision speed.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic and demographic factors.</strong> Urban, suburban, rural. Student demographics. Regional accreditation. These affect institutional priorities.</li>

          <li><strong>Financial health indicators.</strong> Endowment, state funding trends, enrollment trajectory. Institutional health affects buying capacity and priorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your education market focus, current segmentation, and the questions you need answered.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We assess what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions. Institution type and Carnegie classification interactions are often the most revealing cuts.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to prioritize, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring, and territory planning adjustments.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What education data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your sales data to identify which institution types, enrollment sizes, and Carnegie classifications correlate with success. Output includes ICP recommendations, win/loss patterns by institution tier, and resource allocation guidance for selling to schools and universities.</p>

          <h3>How do you segment educational institutions for analysis?</h3>
          <p>We analyze by institution type (K-12, community college, four-year, graduate), Carnegie classification (R1, R2, masters, baccalaureate), enrollment size, public vs. private, and geographic region. These dimensions reveal very different buying patterns.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze K-12 vs. higher ed buying patterns separately?</h3>
          <p>Yes. K-12 and higher education operate as completely different markets with distinct budget cycles, procurement processes, and decision-makers. We analyze each sector separately and identify which segments drive your best outcomes.</p>

          <h3>What about state and district-level K-12 analysis?</h3>
          <p>For K-12, we analyze by district size, state policy environment, urban/suburban/rural classification, and Title I status. State-level buying patterns often differ significantly based on procurement rules and funding models.</p>
