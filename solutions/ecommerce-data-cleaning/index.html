        <h2>The E-commerce B2B Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell tools, services, or platforms to e-commerce companies. Your CRM is stuffed with Shopify merchants, DTC brands, and online retailers. But when your sales team actually tries to use this data, reality hits.</p>

        <p>Half those hot DTC brands from 2021? Gone or pivoted. The founder you've been nurturing? Left to start something new. That e-commerce company that looked perfect? Acquired and absorbed. Your reps are chasing ghosts while real opportunities slip by.</p>

        <p>E-commerce data is uniquely volatile. And most B2B teams selling into this space just accept the mess.</p>

        <h3>E-commerce companies fail or pivot constantly</h3>
        <p>The DTC boom created thousands of brands. Many didn't survive. Others pivoted to wholesale or got acquired. Your prospect database is full of companies that no longer exist in the form you recorded. Your reps waste time researching only to find dead ends.</p>

        <h3>Founders and leaders move fast</h3>
        <p>E-commerce leadership is transient. Founders sell and move on. Marketing directors hop between brands. The decision-maker you targeted six months ago might be three companies removed by now. Your outreach hits old email addresses while the real opportunity is elsewhere.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought Shopify merchant lists, e-commerce brand databases, DTC company data. Each list adds duplicates. Same company, different spellings. Same person, different roles. Your CRM becomes a maze of conflicting records that nobody trusts.</p>

        <h3>Company data goes stale quickly</h3>
        <p>That fast-growing brand you flagged as a target? They might have been acquired, changed names, or shut down their e-commerce operations. E-commerce moves fast. Your static database can't keep up. Targeting becomes guesswork.</p>

        <p>When you're selling to e-commerce, bad data directly costs you deals. Your competitors with clean, current data are already in conversations while your team researches whether prospects still exist.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See How Clean Data Transforms E-commerce Sales</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans E-commerce Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy e-commerce prospect database and make it work for outbound. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that e-commerce companies still exist and are still operating. Closed businesses, acquired brands, and pivoted companies get flagged so your team stops chasing them.</p>
        <p><strong>For teams selling to e-commerce:</strong> Focus on active companies. Stop wasting time on brands that shut down. Know when companies have been acquired or rebranded.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Lists</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names are spelled differently or data came from different purchased lists. We merge intelligently, keeping the most accurate and recent information.</p>
        <p><strong>For teams selling to e-commerce:</strong> One clean record per company. No more calling the same brand from three different records. Clear account ownership in your CRM.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Founders who moved on get flagged. Outdated emails get removed.</p>
        <p><strong>For teams selling to e-commerce:</strong> Reach actual decision-makers. Stop nurturing people who left. Higher email deliverability.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, job titles, and categories into consistent formats. "DTC" and "Direct to Consumer" become standardized. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For teams selling to e-commerce:</strong> Build reliable segments. Target by company type accurately. Personalization that doesn't look broken.</p>

        <h2>What Teams Selling to E-commerce Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on active opportunities.</strong> Stop researching companies only to discover they shut down. Every record in your database represents a real, operating e-commerce business.</li>

          <li><strong>Reach actual decision-makers.</strong> When contacts are validated and job changes flagged, your outreach hits real people at their current companies. Not former founders at defunct brands.</li>

          <li><strong>Eliminate duplicate outreach.</strong> When your purchased lists are deduplicated, you stop embarrassing yourself by contacting the same brand from multiple records. Your team looks professional.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline numbers.</strong> Clean data means accurate reporting. Know how many real e-commerce opportunities you have, not how many duplicate or dead records exist.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve email deliverability.</strong> Invalid emails hurt your sender reputation across all campaigns. Clean email data means higher inbox placement for all your outbound.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your e-commerce prospect database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        E-commerce data gets stale fast. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About E-commerce Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of e-commerce data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>B2B prospect lists targeting e-commerce brands, DTC company databases, Shopify merchant lists, e-commerce decision-maker contacts, and any data your sales team uses to reach online retailers.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify which e-commerce platform companies use?</h3>
          <p>Platform identification (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, etc.) is part of our data enrichment service. Data cleaning focuses on fixing what you have—deduplication, validation, and standardization. We offer both services, and they work well together.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean multiple purchased lists at once?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We often receive data from multiple list vendors simultaneously. We can clean and deduplicate across all sources, giving you one unified, clean database.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our e-commerce prospect data?</h3>
          <p>Given the volatility of e-commerce—companies failing, pivoting, getting acquired—quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after purchasing new lists.</p>
