        <h2>The E-commerce Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're running an online store or D2C brand. Your database holds years of customer transactions, email signups, and loyalty program data. But that data has become fragmented and unreliable.</p>

        <p>E-commerce data degrades fast. Customers use different emails, checkout as guests, and create new accounts when they forget passwords. Marketing campaigns generate leads that never convert. Email addresses go stale. Your customer lifetime value calculations are wrong because the same person appears as multiple customers.</p>

        <h3>Customers exist multiple times</h3>
        <p>john@gmail.com placed an order last year. john.smith@gmail.com checked out as a guest. J Smith used a work email for a different order. Now you have three customers who are actually one person. Your email campaigns hit them multiple times. Your loyalty program shows three small accounts instead of one valuable customer.</p>

        <h3>Guest checkouts create chaos</h3>
        <p>Every guest checkout is a potential duplicate. Customers who forget their passwords check out as guests. Your database grows with records that should be consolidated with existing accounts. True customer count and CLV become impossible to measure accurately.</p>

        <h3>Email addresses go bad</h3>
        <p>People change email providers, abandon old addresses, and let inboxes fill up. Your marketing emails bounce. Your abandoned cart sequences don't reach customers. Your email reputation suffers from sending to invalid addresses.</p>

        <h3>Vendor and supplier data is messy</h3>
        <p>If you work with vendors, suppliers, or wholesale accounts, that B2B data has its own problems. Company names are inconsistent. Contacts have changed. Your vendor management becomes difficult when you can't trust the underlying data.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans E-commerce Data</h2>

        <p>We understand both sides of e-commerce data: customer databases that need deduplication and purchase history consolidation, and B2B partner data that needs validation and standardization.</p>

        <h3>Customer deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match customer records across emails, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and name variations. We understand that the same person creates multiple accounts over time. We consolidate profiles while preserving complete purchase history and loyalty data from all sources.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per customer with complete purchase history, plus merge logs showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Email validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses for deliverability. We identify invalid addresses, catch-all domains, and high-risk emails before they damage your sender reputation. Your marketing campaigns reach real customers.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with risk flags on problematic addresses.</p>

        <h3>Guest checkout consolidation</h3>
        <p>We match guest checkout records to existing customer accounts based on email, phone, and shipping address patterns. Guest orders get attributed to the right customer profiles, improving your CLV accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Guest orders properly attributed to customer profiles for accurate analytics.</p>

        <h3>Vendor data standardization</h3>
        <p>For B2B data, we normalize company names, validate contacts, and standardize records across your vendor and supplier databases. Your procurement and vendor management systems work with accurate data.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent vendor records enabling accurate spend analysis and relationship management.</p>

        <h2>What E-commerce Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Calculate true customer value.</strong> When purchase history is consolidated, you can see actual CLV and identify your best customers accurately.</li>
          <li><strong>Run targeted campaigns.</strong> Clean, deduplicated data means each customer gets one message instead of multiple. Personalization actually works.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve email deliverability.</strong> Validated emails mean higher deliverability rates and better sender reputation.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your analytics.</strong> Accurate customer counts and purchase data mean your business intelligence reflects reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Manage vendors effectively.</strong> Clean B2B data means your vendor relationships and procurement processes work smoothly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull customer, order, and vendor data from your e-commerce platform or CRM. We work with exports from Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, invalid emails, and inconsistencies. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex customer matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate customer data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle customer duplicates across channels?</h3>
          <p>We match customer records across email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and name variations. We consolidate into single records while preserving complete purchase history from all sources.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean both B2C customer and B2B vendor data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We clean both with different approaches. For customers, we focus on deduplication and purchase history consolidation. For B2B partners, we standardize company names and validate contacts.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with Shopify, WooCommerce, and other platform exports?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. We regularly clean data exported from Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, and other e-commerce platforms. We understand the data structures.</p>

          <h3>How long does e-commerce data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 100,000 records. Larger datasets may take 3-5 business days.</p>

          <h3>Will you preserve purchase history when merging duplicates?</h3>
          <p>Yes. When we merge duplicate customer records, we preserve all order history, loyalty points, and engagement data. Nothing is lost in consolidation.</p>
