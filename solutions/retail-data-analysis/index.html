        <h2>The Retail Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>Retail is a massive, fragmented market. National chains, regional players, specialty boutiques, e-commerce pure-plays, DTC brands with wholesale ambitions. You can't pursue them all with equal intensity.</p>

        <p>Most companies selling to retail segment by obvious factors: store count, revenue, maybe vertical category. But these broad categories hide the patterns that actually predict success. A 50-store specialty chain might be worth 10x a 500-store discount retailer.</p>

        <p>Which retailer types have the highest win rates? Where does omnichannel maturity correlate with deal velocity? Which segments expand after initial purchase? Your historical data contains these answers, but extracting them requires analysis most teams don't have bandwidth for.</p>

        <h3>Store count doesn't tell the whole story</h3>
        <p>A 200-store regional grocer and a 200-store fashion retailer have completely different tech stacks, buying processes, and budget cycles. Treating them the same wastes resources and misses opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Omnichannel maturity matters more than size</h3>
        <p>Retailers investing in unified commerce, BOPIS, and mobile apps often have different buying patterns than those still running legacy systems. Digital transformation stage predicts technology adoption better than revenue.</p>

        <h3>Buyer turnover creates chaos</h3>
        <p>Retail buyers turn over at 60% annually. The champion who signed your deal might be gone in 18 months. Understanding which accounts maintain relationships despite turnover is critical for expansion and retention.</p>

        <h2>What Retail Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not dashboards. Recommendations you can act on.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Segment</h3>
        <p>Which retailer types are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across segments to identify where you should focus.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Mid-market specialty retailers (50&#8209;200 stores) have 4x higher LTV than large discount chains, despite smaller initial deals. They expand faster and churn less."</p>

        <h3>Store Count and Revenue Analysis</h3>
        <p>Does store count correlate with success? Often the relationship isn't linear. We identify the sweet spots where your solution delivers the most value and stickiness.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Retailers with 100&#8209;300 stores close 2.5x faster than those with 500+ stores. Enterprise deals take longer but expansion rates are similar."</p>

        <h3>Omnichannel Maturity Patterns</h3>
        <p>We analyze how digital capabilities correlate with buying behavior. Retailers at different stages of omnichannel transformation have different needs and urgency.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Retailers with active BOPIS programs close 35% faster and have 50% higher NRR. They've already bought into unified commerce and need enabling technology."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Churn Indicators</h3>
        <p>Which customers expand after initial purchase? Which churn? We identify the characteristics and behaviors that predict post-sale trajectory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Accounts where we have relationships with both merchandising and IT have 70% higher retention. Single-threaded deals in retail are high churn risk."</p>

        <h2>Retail-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Retailer type.</strong> Big-box, specialty, grocery, convenience, department stores, e-commerce pure-plays. Each has distinct buying patterns and budget cycles.</li>

          <li><strong>Store count and footprint.</strong> Does size correlate with success? Often mid-market outperforms both small and enterprise. We find where you win.</li>

          <li><strong>Omnichannel maturity.</strong> E-commerce penetration, BOPIS adoption, mobile app presence, unified commerce investment. Digital sophistication predicts technology adoption.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic patterns.</strong> Regional retailers vs. national chains. Headquarters location and store concentration often correlate with buying behavior.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> POS system, e-commerce platform, OMS/WMS vendors. Integration complexity varies dramatically by stack.</li>

          <li><strong>Category vertical.</strong> Fashion, grocery, home goods, electronics, beauty. Each vertical has unique seasonality and buying committee composition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your retail market, current segmentation approach, and the questions you're trying to answer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions, looking for patterns that predict success. Store count, omnichannel maturity, and vertical category are central to the analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to prioritize, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring adjustments, and resource allocation changes.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
