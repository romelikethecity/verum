        <h2>The E-commerce Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's Black Friday prep. Your marketing team is building the email campaigns that will drive half your Q4 revenue. Segmented lists, personalized offers, the whole playbook. Everything's ready.</p>

        <p>The emails go out. Bounce rates come back at 18%. Your abandoned cart recovery sequence hits inboxes of people who already bought. Your "loyal customer" segment includes people who haven't purchased in three years. The personalization engine recommended winter coats to someone in Miami who just bought one.</p>

        <p>Your customer database is technically full of data. It's just not accurate data.</p>

        <h3>Customer emails decay faster than you think</h3>
        <p>People change email addresses when they change jobs, switch providers, or just want a fresh start. Research shows email databases decay at roughly 25% per year. That promotional email you're crafting might be going to an inbox nobody checks anymore. Worse, high bounce rates hurt your sender reputation with ISPs.</p>

        <h3>One customer, five different records</h3>
        <p>Same person bought with their work email in 2021, personal email in 2022, and a typo'd version in 2023. They used three different shipping addresses. Your CDP sees three separate customers. Your lifetime value calculations are fiction. Your "new customer" promotions go to repeat buyers.</p>

        <h3>Addresses go stale silently</h3>
        <p>People move. A lot. About 10% of Americans change addresses every year. Your shipping address on file might be where they lived two apartments ago. Returns pile up. Packages get lost. Customer satisfaction tanks for reasons that have nothing to do with your product.</p>

        <h3>Segmentation built on bad data backfires</h3>
        <p>You can't personalize effectively when the underlying data is wrong. Recommending products based on outdated purchase history. Sending win-back campaigns to active customers. Offering first-time buyer discounts to your best customers. Every bad segment is money left on the table or, worse, customers actively annoyed.</p>

        <p>Every undelivered email is a sale you didn't make. Every duplicate record is a customer you don't understand. Every wrong address is a package that won't arrive. Your competitors with clean data are converting at higher rates while you're troubleshooting deliverability.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves E-commerce Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a data team just to know who your customers actually are. Verum takes your customer database, your email lists, your CDP exports, and makes them accurate. We verify emails, deduplicate records, update addresses, and enrich profiles. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Email Verification That Works</h3>
        <p>We validate every email address against deliverability databases, catch typos, flag role-based addresses, and identify inbox status. Your bounce rates drop. Your sender reputation improves.</p>
        <p><strong>For e-commerce teams:</strong> Stop tanking your email deliverability with bad addresses. Get your promotional emails into actual inboxes.</p>

        <h3>Customer Record Deduplication</h3>
        <p>Same customer, different records. We merge them intelligently, preserving purchase history and combining profile data. One customer, one complete view.</p>
        <p><strong>For e-commerce teams:</strong> Calculate actual customer lifetime value. Stop sending new customer promos to your VIPs.</p>

        <h3>Address Verification and Standardization</h3>
        <p>We validate shipping addresses against postal databases, standardize formatting, and flag addresses that might be outdated or undeliverable.</p>
        <p><strong>For e-commerce teams:</strong> Reduce failed deliveries and returns. Get packages where they're supposed to go.</p>

        <h3>Customer Profile Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing demographics? Purchase behavior patterns? We append data that makes segmentation actually work. Know which customers are likely to buy again and which need win-back attention.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before delivery. E-commerce data has nuances. Gift purchases versus personal purchases. Business addresses versus residential. We catch what algorithms miss.</p>

        <h2>What E-commerce Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Improve email campaign performance.</strong> Lower bounce rates mean better deliverability. Better deliverability means more emails in inboxes. More inboxes mean more conversions.</li>

          <li><strong>Personalize without embarrassment.</strong> Recommendations that actually make sense. Segments that reflect reality. Promotions that reach the right customers at the right time.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce shipping failures.</strong> Verified addresses mean packages arrive. Fewer returns due to bad addresses. Better customer experience without the support tickets.</li>

          <li><strong>Calculate real customer lifetime value.</strong> When duplicate records merge into single customer views, you finally know who your best customers actually are.</li>

          <li><strong>Run abandoned cart recovery that works.</strong> Reach customers who actually abandoned, not people who already bought. Better targeting, better conversion rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Shopify? Klaviyo? Custom platform? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        E-commerce data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes before major sale seasons. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About E-commerce Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any platform.</p>

          <h3>Can you work with our e-commerce platform?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, and custom platforms. If your system can export customer data, we can clean it. We'll return it in whatever format you need.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle customer privacy?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We understand customer data is sensitive. We don't sell or share your customer information.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells B2B contact databases. If you need net-new business leads, that's their strength. But if you already have years of customer data that needs cleaning? That's us. We fix what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before holiday season, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about email deliverability guarantees?</h3>
          <p>We guarantee 93% deliverability on the email addresses we verify. If you see significantly higher bounce rates on our verified data, we'll re-clean at no charge.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with DTC startups and enterprise retailers. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of scale. A customer database with 10,000 records has the same issues as one with 10 million.</p>
