        <h2>The Nonprofit Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're running development and fundraising operations for a nonprofit. Your CRM holds years of donor relationships, giving history, and constituent data. But that data has become fragmented and unreliable.</p>

        <p>Nonprofit data has unique challenges. Donors move frequently. Name variations create duplicates. Household relationships break when spouses have different last names. And decades of data entry by volunteers and staff have created inconsistencies throughout your database.</p>

        <h3>Donors are duplicated everywhere</h3>
        <p>"Robert Smith" and "Bob Smith" and "R. Smith" are all in your database. Maybe they're the same major donor. Maybe they're different people. Your giving reports show inflated donor counts. Your stewardship is fractured because you can't see the full relationship.</p>

        <h3>Contact information is outdated</h3>
        <p>Donors move. Email addresses change. Phone numbers update. Your annual fund appeals return to sender. Your cultivation emails bounce. You're spending money on communications that never reach your constituents.</p>

        <h3>Household relationships are broken</h3>
        <p>Married couples should be linked. But when spouses have different last names or were entered separately, they appear as unrelated donors. Your major gift officers can't see household giving capacity. Your recognition levels are wrong.</p>

        <h3>Corporate and foundation data is inconsistent</h3>
        <p>The same foundation appears under different names. Corporate sponsor contacts have changed. Grant maker data from different sources doesn't match. Your institutional fundraising is hampered by messy organizational records.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Nonprofit Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the relationship-driven nature of nonprofit fundraising. Giving history matters. Donor relationships matter. We clean your data while preserving the context that makes it valuable.</p>

        <h3>Donor deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match donor records across names, addresses, emails, and giving patterns. We understand name variations, maiden names, and the ways donors get entered multiple times. We consolidate duplicates while preserving complete giving history.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per donor with complete giving history, plus merge logs showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses and physical addresses for your constituents. Nonprofit communications require deliverability. We flag outdated addresses, identify deceased donors where records are available, and validate current contact information.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with NCOA updates for physical addresses.</p>

        <h3>Household consolidation</h3>
        <p>We link related donors into proper households based on address matching, name analysis, and relationship indicators. Married couples, partners, and family members get connected so you can see true household giving.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Accurate household relationships enabling proper recognition and cultivation.</p>

        <h3>Organization standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize foundation names, corporate sponsor records, and institutional funder data. We validate contacts and update organizational information. Your grant and corporate fundraising works with reliable data.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent organizational records enabling effective institutional fundraising.</p>

        <h2>What Development Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>See true donor value.</strong> Consolidated records show each donor's complete giving history, enabling accurate recognition and cultivation.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify major gift prospects.</strong> Household consolidation reveals true giving capacity that was hidden across duplicate records.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve appeal response.</strong> Validated addresses mean your appeals actually reach donors instead of bouncing.</li>
          <li><strong>Run accurate reports.</strong> Clean data means your board reports, campaign progress, and donor retention metrics reflect reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Steward effectively.</strong> When you can see the full relationship, you can thank donors appropriately and cultivate them properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull donor and constituent data from your CRM. We work with exports from Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud, Bloomerang, Blackbaud, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, stale contacts, and broken relationships. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, household linking. Human review on complex donor matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your development team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>
