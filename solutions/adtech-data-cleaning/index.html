        <h2>The AdTech Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Advertising technology companies deal with some of the messiest data in B2B. You're selling to agencies with complex holding company structures. Brands with constantly changing marketing teams. Media buyers who change jobs every 18 months. And everyone has been touched by multiple vendors, events, and sales efforts.</p>

        <p>AdTech data has unique challenges. Agency hierarchies are confusing. The same agency might appear under its own name, its network name, and its holding company name. Media buyers move so frequently that half your contacts are at different agencies than your records show. And the advertising industry's constant M&A creates orphaned records everywhere.</p>

        <h3>Agency hierarchies are a mess</h3>
        <p>"Mindshare" and "GroupM" and "WPP" might all appear in your CRM for the same relationship. Is it three separate accounts or one? Your ABM campaigns break when you can't accurately count coverage at each agency or holding company.</p>

        <h3>Media buyers move constantly</h3>
        <p>A media buyer at Horizon today might be at an in-house brand team next month and at a different agency next year. Your database is full of people at the wrong companies, and you're emailing them at addresses that bounce.</p>

        <h3>Brand marketing teams churn</h3>
        <p>CMOs average 40 months in role. Media directors even less. The brand contacts you built relationships with are gone, but your CRM still shows them there. Every bounce and wrong-person response hurts your reputation.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates from events and outreach</h3>
        <p>Advertising Week. Cannes Lions. DMEXCO. Every event creates a batch of leads that overlap with your existing database. Now you have the same media planner listed three times with different information from each event.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans AdTech Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the advertising ecosystem. Holding company structures. Agency networks. Brand marketing org charts. We clean your data with this context in mind.</p>

        <h3>Agency hierarchy standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize agency names and map them to proper hierarchies. Mindshare connects to GroupM connects to WPP. You can segment and report at any level of the hierarchy, and your account counts actually make sense.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized agency names with holding company and network relationships mapped.</p>

        <h3>Contact deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match contacts across events, campaigns, and touchpoints. We consolidate duplicates while preserving engagement history. One golden record per person, regardless of how many times they've been added.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Deduplicated contacts with complete engagement history preserved.</p>

        <h3>Employment validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Media buying's high turnover means stale data accumulates fast. We flag people who've moved and can identify their new employers.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Current employment status with job change flags on stale records.</p>

        <h3>Email validation</h3>
        <p>We verify every email for deliverability. Advertising contacts change emails frequently as they change jobs. We catch invalid addresses before they hurt your sender reputation.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails.</p>

        <h2>What AdTech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run effective ABM at agencies.</strong> When agency hierarchies are mapped, you can coordinate campaigns across GroupM or target specific agencies within a holding company.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop emailing the wrong people.</strong> Employment validation means you're reaching current employees, not people who left two jobs ago.</li>
          <li><strong>Track job changes as opportunities.</strong> When media buyers move, it creates new opportunities. Clean data shows you where your contacts have landed.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce email bounces.</strong> Validated emails protect your sender reputation and improve campaign performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline metrics.</strong> When duplicates are removed and companies are properly attributed, your revenue reporting actually makes sense.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contacts and accounts from your CRM. We work with exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, agency hierarchy issues, employment validation, and email health. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, hierarchy mapping, validation. Human review on complex agency relationships. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>
