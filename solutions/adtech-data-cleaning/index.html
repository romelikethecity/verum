        <h2>The AdTech Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Your programmatic team builds audience segments. Job titles, company sizes, industries. The targeting looks precise in the DMP. Then the campaign launches and performance disappoints.</p>

        <p>Someone pulls a sample. Half the records are duplicates inflating your audience counts. A third of the job titles are outdated. Email formats are inconsistent across systems. The whole foundation was dirty before a single impression was served.</p>

        <p>This is the adtech data quality crisis that nobody wants to talk about.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates inflate your audience counts</h3>
        <p>The same person exists in your system three, five, sometimes ten times. Different email variations. Slightly different name spellings. Your reach calculations are fiction. Your frequency caps don't work because the system doesn't know it's the same person. You're serving the same ads repeatedly to the same people and calling it scale.</p>

        <h3>Format inconsistencies break your targeting</h3>
        <p>One system stores phone numbers as (555) 123-4567. Another uses 5551234567. A third has +1-555-123-4567. Same story with addresses, company names, job titles. When formats don't match, your identity resolution fails. Your segments miss people who should be included. Your exclusions don't work.</p>

        <h3>Invalid data wastes impressions</h3>
        <p>Emails that bounce. Phone numbers that don't exist. Companies that went out of business. Every record that shouldn't be in your audience is money spent targeting nobody. The CPMs are the same whether the data is valid or not.</p>

        <h3>Data sprawl across systems compounds the mess</h3>
        <p>DMP, CDP, CRM, email platform, analytics tools. Each system has its own version of the truth. None of them match. When you try to build cross-channel audiences, you're combining dirty data with more dirty data. The errors multiply.</p>

        <p>Clean data isn't a nice-to-have in adtech. It's the foundation everything else depends on. Dirty data means wasted spend, wrong targeting, and campaigns that underperform no matter how good your creative is.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans AdTech Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy audience data and make it usable. No platform to learn. No integration project. Send us your files, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication That Actually Works</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when names are spelled differently, emails vary, or data was entered inconsistently. We merge records intelligently, preserving the most complete and accurate information from each duplicate.</p>
        <p><strong>For adtech teams:</strong> Accurate audience counts. Frequency caps that work. Stop paying to reach the same person multiple times.</p>

        <h3>Format Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize phone numbers, addresses, company names, job titles, and every other field into consistent formats. Your data works across systems. Your identity resolution actually resolves identities.</p>
        <p><strong>For adtech teams:</strong> Cross-channel audiences that match correctly. Targeting rules that fire consistently. Data that flows between systems without breaking.</p>

        <h3>Email Validation and Verification</h3>
        <p>We check every email address against multiple validation sources. Syntax errors, invalid domains, known spam traps, and deliverability signals. Bad emails get flagged before they waste your budget.</p>
        <p><strong>For adtech teams:</strong> Higher deliverability rates. Fewer bounces. Better sender reputation for email-based campaigns.</p>

        <h3>Record Validation and Correction</h3>
        <p>We verify company names against business registries, check that phone numbers are real, and validate addresses actually exist. Where data is correctable, we fix it. Where it's not, we flag it so you can decide what to do.</p>
        <p><strong>For adtech teams:</strong> Confidence that your audience data represents real people at real companies. Targeting that reaches actual prospects.</p>

        <h2>What AdTech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Build accurate audience segments.</strong> When duplicates are removed and data is standardized, your segment sizes reflect reality. Planning and forecasting actually work.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve campaign performance.</strong> Clean targeting data means ads reach the right people. CTRs improve. Conversions follow. Clients see results.</li>

          <li><strong>Enable proper frequency management.</strong> When the same person isn't in your system multiple times, frequency caps actually cap frequency. Stop annoying prospects with repetitive ads.</li>

          <li><strong>Make identity resolution work.</strong> Clean, standardized data is the prerequisite for identity graphs doing their job. Your cross-device matching improves when inputs are accurate.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce wasted ad spend.</strong> Every invalid email, fake phone number, and defunct company removed from your audiences is money saved on impressions that would reach nobody.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data challenges. We'll give you an honest picture of what cleaning can realistically accomplish for your situation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific issues. DMP? CDP? CRM? We've worked with exports from all of them.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Data gets dirty again. New records come in messy. We can run periodic cleaning to keep your foundation solid. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About AdTech Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does adtech data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets or complex requirements might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of adtech data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Audience segments, customer lists, CRM exports, DMP data, CDP exports, email lists, and any first-party data you use for targeting. We work with whatever formats your systems can export.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from data enrichment?</h3>
          <p>Data cleaning fixes what you have—removing duplicates, standardizing formats, validating emails, correcting errors. Data enrichment adds new information to existing records. Most adtech companies need both. We offer both services, and they work well together.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, JSON, Excel, database exports. If your systems can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import process.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle sensitive data?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, secure processing environment, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We understand adtech compliance requirements.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean data from multiple sources at once?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We often receive data from DMP, CRM, and other systems simultaneously. We can clean and deduplicate across sources, giving you one unified clean dataset.</p>
