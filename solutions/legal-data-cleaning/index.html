        <h2>The Legal Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell technology, services, or consulting to law firms. Your CRM contains Am Law firms, regional practices, boutiques, and corporate legal departments. But the legal industry is constantly reshuffling.</p>

        <p>That partner you've been nurturing? Went lateral to a competitor last quarter. The firm you built a relationship with? Merged with a larger practice. The managing partner on your target list? Retired after 30 years. Your database reflects a legal landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Legal data has unique challenges. Partner lateral moves, firm mergers, and the way firms restructure practice groups mean your prospect data goes stale faster than you'd expect.</p>

        <h3>Partner lateral moves are constant</h3>
        <p>Partners move between firms regularly, often bringing clients and practice groups with them. Your target partner might be at a completely different firm than your CRM shows. The relationship you built follows the person, not the firm name in your database.</p>

        <h3>Firm mergers and dissolutions</h3>
        <p>Firms merge, acquire practice groups, and sometimes dissolve entirely. Regional firms join national platforms. Boutiques get absorbed. Your target account list includes firms that no longer exist as independent entities.</p>

        <h3>Legal titles and hierarchies vary</h3>
        <p>"Managing Partner," "Chairman," "Executive Director," "Chief Operating Officer"—the same decision-making role appears under different titles at different firms. Your segmentation breaks when you can't identify who actually makes purchasing decisions.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought attorney directories, law firm databases, legal leader lists. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different levels of accuracy. Now you have the same firm five times with conflicting information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for legal sales. Long sales cycles and relationship-driven selling mean you can't afford to waste months pursuing partners who left or firms that merged.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Legal Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy legal database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation and Lateral Tracking</h3>
        <p>We verify that attorneys are still at the firms you think they are. Partner moves, retirements, and departures get flagged so you can update your outreach accordingly.</p>
        <p><strong>For legal sales teams:</strong> Stop nurturing partners who left. Know when decision-makers move firms. Follow relationships, not outdated database entries.</p>

        <h3>Firm Validation and M&A Tracking</h3>
        <p>We verify that law firms still exist as independent entities, flag those that have merged or dissolved, and update records where we can identify successor firms.</p>
        <p><strong>For legal sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing firms that merged. Know when targets have been acquired. Focus on firms that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when firm names vary or data came from different sources. We handle name variations and office location distinctions.</p>
        <p><strong>For legal sales teams:</strong> One clean record per firm. Clear understanding of multi-office structures. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize firm names, practice areas, titles, and office locations into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For legal sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by firm size, practice area, or geography. Target Am Law 100 vs. regional differently. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Legal Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Track partner moves.</strong> When decision-makers move between firms, you know about it. Your relationship follows them to their new firm instead of dying in outdated data.</li>

          <li><strong>Focus on active firms.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on firms that merged or dissolved. Every account in your database represents a real firm that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by firm type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target Am Law firms differently from regional practices, corporate departments differently from law firms. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate multi-office structures.</strong> Understand which office makes which decisions. Know who to contact at firms with dozens of locations.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Partner laterals happen constantly. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Legal Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of legal data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Law firm databases, attorney contact lists, corporate legal department data, general counsel contacts, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the legal industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you track partner lateral moves?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We cross-reference attorney contacts against current employment data and flag records where partners appear to have moved firms. This is especially valuable in legal where lateral moves are common.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you help segment by Am Law ranking?</h3>
          <p>We can help standardize firm data that enables ranking-based segmentation. Firm size, revenue tier, and other attributes can be normalized for targeting purposes.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our legal data?</h3>
          <p>Given the frequency of partner laterals, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after lateral seasons.</p>
