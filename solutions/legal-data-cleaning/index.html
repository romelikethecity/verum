        <h2>The Legal Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to law firms. Partners, associates, legal operations, IT. Your CRM has thousands of attorney records. But how many of those are still at the firm you think they're at?</p>

        <p>Legal is one of the highest-turnover industries for contact data. Associates churn constantly. Partners move between firms for rainmaking opportunities. Firms merge and dissolve. And the practice area taxonomy that made sense when you imported that list three years ago doesn't match how you segment today.</p>

        <h3>Attorneys move constantly</h3>
        <p>The associate you talked to last year made partner and jumped to a competitor. The partner who was your champion went in-house. The whole M&A practice group moved to a rival firm. Every move creates a stale record and potentially a missed opportunity at their new firm.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates from multiple touchpoints</h3>
        <p>You met them at LegalTech. You got their card at ILTACON. Marketing imported them from a webinar. Now you have three records with different practice areas listed and slightly different email formats. Your rep doesn't know which record to use, so they guess. Or worse, email all three.</p>

        <h3>Practice area chaos</h3>
        <p>"Litigation" and "Commercial Litigation" and "Business Litigation" and "Complex Litigation" are probably the same thing. Maybe. Your segmentation doesn't work when practice areas are inconsistent, and your reps can't target IP attorneys when half of them are labeled "Intellectual Property" and half are "Patent."</p>

        <h3>Firm names are a mess</h3>
        <p>"Skadden" and "Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom" and "Skadden Arps" are the same firm. Your ABM campaigns break when you can't count how many contacts you have at each firm. Lead routing fails. Territory assignments don't work.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Legal Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the nuances of legal industry data. Partner vs associate vs counsel vs of counsel distinctions. Practice group structures. Multi-office firms. Bar admission requirements.</p>

        <h3>Attorney deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match on more than email. Bar numbers, firm affiliations, practice areas, and name variations help us identify when multiple records belong to the same attorney. John Smith, J. Robert Smith, and Jack Smith might all be the same partner. We figure that out.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per attorney with the most complete and current information, plus a merge log showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Bar number validation</h3>
        <p>We verify bar numbers against state bar databases. Is the attorney active and in good standing? Does the bar number actually belong to the person in your record? We catch suspended attorneys, retired attorneys, and data entry errors.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Validated bar numbers with status flags for any issues discovered.</p>

        <h3>Practice area standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize practice areas to a consistent taxonomy. "IP," "Intellectual Property," "Patents," and "Patent Prosecution" get mapped correctly so your segmentation actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized practice areas ready for targeting and campaign segmentation.</p>

        <h3>Firm name normalization</h3>
        <p>We standardize firm names so "Latham" and "Latham & Watkins" and "Latham & Watkins LLP" become one consistent entry. We understand firm abbreviations and official naming conventions.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent firm names enabling accurate account-level reporting and ABM campaigns.</p>

        <h3>Email validation</h3>
        <p>Law firm email systems are often strict. We verify every email for deliverability and flag addresses that have bounced, changed, or belong to attorneys who've left the firm.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails.</p>

        <h2>What Legal Tech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run targeted practice area campaigns.</strong> When IP attorneys are actually labeled as IP attorneys, your campaigns hit the right people with the right message.</li>
          <li><strong>Execute ABM against top firms.</strong> Clean firm data means you can count contacts at each Am Law 100 firm and run coordinated multi-touch campaigns.</li>
          <li><strong>Track job changes.</strong> Cleaned data shows you when attorneys have moved, letting you reach out at their new firm and remove stale records.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop embarrassing mistakes.</strong> No more emailing partners who left the firm, or calling associates who are now at competitors.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline reporting.</strong> When duplicates are gone and firms are standardized, your revenue data by firm segment actually means something.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contacts from Salesforce, HubSpot, or your legal CRM. We work with standard exports.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, bar number issues, practice area inconsistencies, and email validity. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on edge cases. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes made.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Can you validate attorney bar numbers?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We verify bar numbers against state bar databases to confirm the attorney is active and in good standing. We flag records where bar numbers don't match names, have been suspended, or belong to attorneys who are no longer practicing.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle attorneys at multiple firms?</h3>
          <p>Attorneys move between firms frequently. We identify when an attorney has moved and flag the old record. We can also identify if you have the same attorney listed at their old firm and new firm, which creates confusion in outreach and reporting.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with Am Law 100 data specifically?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We have strong coverage of Am Law 100 and Am Law 200 firms. We understand the partner vs associate vs counsel distinctions, practice group structures, and office hierarchies that matter for targeting.</p>

          <h3>How long does legal data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most legal data cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Projects with bar number validation across multiple states may take 3-5 business days.</p>

          <h3>What about solo practitioners and small firms?</h3>
          <p>We clean data for all firm sizes. Solo practitioners and small firms actually have higher data decay because they change more often. We validate bar numbers and emails regardless of firm size.</p>
