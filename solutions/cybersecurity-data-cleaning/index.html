        <h2>The Cybersecurity Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling security solutions. Your prospects are CISOs, security architects, and IT leaders who get bombarded with vendor outreach. Every bounced email and wrong-person call damages your reputation in a tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone.</p>

        <p>Cybersecurity has some of the highest contact turnover in B2B. CISOs average 18-24 months in role before moving on. Security teams get reshuffled constantly. And every RSA Conference dumps thousands of new badge scans into your CRM without any deduplication.</p>

        <h3>Security leaders move constantly</h3>
        <p>The CISO role is a revolving door. Burnout, better offers, and board pressure drive constant movement. That CISO you talked to at Black Hat might be at a competitor by the time you follow up. Your CRM doesn't know, so your SDR calls and gets an awkward "she doesn't work here anymore."</p>

        <h3>Conference lists create chaos</h3>
        <p>RSA, Black Hat, Gartner Security Summit. Every conference generates thousands of badge scans that marketing imports. Half are already in your CRM. Some gave fake emails. Others have changed jobs since. Without cleanup, you're polluting your database with garbage data.</p>

        <h3>Title chaos in security</h3>
        <p>CISO and CSO and VP of Security and Head of Information Security and Chief Security Officer are often the same role. Your segmentation breaks when you can't reliably target CISOs because half of them have variant titles.</p>

        <h3>Vendor consolidation scrambles accounts</h3>
        <p>Security vendors get acquired constantly. The startup your champion used to work at is now part of a larger company. Company names in your CRM are outdated, and you can't tell which accounts are actually the same organization post-merger.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Cybersecurity Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the unique challenges of selling into security. High turnover, conference-heavy lead generation, and a community where reputation matters.</p>

        <h3>Job change detection</h3>
        <p>We identify when security leaders have moved companies. The CISO who left? We'll flag that record and can tell you where they went. You stop embarrassing outreach to people who've moved on and can reconnect at their new organization.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Flagged records for departed contacts with their new company information where available.</p>

        <h3>Conference list deduplication</h3>
        <p>We dedupe your RSA, Black Hat, and other conference lists against your existing CRM. We catch the duplicates, validate the emails, and identify which contacts are worth adding versus which are already in your database.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Clean conference leads ready to import without polluting your existing data.</p>

        <h3>Security title standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize CISO, CSO, VP Security, and variant titles to a consistent taxonomy. We understand the security org chart and can map titles to appropriate seniority levels for your segmentation.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized security titles that make targeting and routing work correctly.</p>

        <h3>Email validation</h3>
        <p>Security professionals change emails when they change jobs. We verify every email for current deliverability and flag addresses that have bounced, changed, or belong to contacts who've left their organization.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails.</p>

        <h2>What Cybersecurity Vendors Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Protect your reputation.</strong> Security is a small world. Bounced emails and wrong-person calls get talked about. Clean data means professional outreach that doesn't embarrass your brand.</li>
          <li><strong>Maximize conference ROI.</strong> When your RSA leads are clean and deduplicated, you can actually measure conference ROI and follow up effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>Target CISOs accurately.</strong> Standardized titles mean your CISO campaign actually reaches CISOs, regardless of how their company lists the role.</li>
          <li><strong>Track job changes.</strong> Security leaders who moved are warm leads at their new company. Clean data helps you find them again.</li>
          <li><strong>Run effective ABM.</strong> When duplicates are gone and company names are standardized, your account-based campaigns work as intended.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contacts from your CRM or send us that conference list. We work with standard exports.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, job change indicators, email validity, and title inconsistencies. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on edge cases. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes made.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle CISO job changes?</h3>
          <p>CISOs move frequently, averaging 18-24 months in role. We identify when security leaders have changed companies and flag stale records. We can also track where they went, so you can reach out at their new organization while removing the outdated record.</p>

          <h3>What about standardizing security titles?</h3>
          <p>Security titles are all over the map. CISO, CSO, VP Security, Head of Information Security, Chief Security Officer. We normalize these to a consistent taxonomy so your segmentation and routing work correctly.</p>

          <h3>How long does cybersecurity data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most cybersecurity CRM cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Post-conference list cleaning is often same-day since those files are smaller.</p>

          <h3>Do you handle international security contacts?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We have good coverage for US, UK, and Western European security professionals. Coverage varies for other regions. We'll tell you expected accuracy rates for your specific data before you commit.</p>
