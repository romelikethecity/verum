        <h2>The AdTech Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling advertising technology. DSPs, SSPs, attribution, measurement, creative platforms. Your buyers are media professionals who get pitched constantly. Generic outreach doesn't work. You need precise targeting and relevant positioning.</p>

        <p>AdTech buyer data has unique challenges. Agency structures are confusing. Media buyers change jobs constantly. Ad spend information is guarded. And the signals that indicate platform reviews and buying intent aren't publicly visible. Your SDRs spend hours researching each account before they can start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>Media contacts are hard to reach</h3>
        <p>Media planners and buyers are bombarded by adtech vendors. They're protective of their time. General agency lines go nowhere. Without verified direct contact information, you're not getting through to the people who make platform decisions.</p>

        <h3>Agency hierarchies are complex</h3>
        <p>Is it a holding company decision or an agency decision? Which agencies within a network handle which clients? You need to understand the structure to know who to target and how to position.</p>

        <h3>Spend data determines fit</h3>
        <p>A brand spending $100M on digital advertising has different needs than one spending $1M. You need signals that indicate advertising investment to qualify effectively. But exact budgets aren't published.</p>

        <h3>Client relationships matter</h3>
        <p>If you're selling to agencies, knowing which brands they represent changes your positioning entirely. But agency-client relationships shift constantly and aren't always public.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that adtech sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage agencies and brands.</p>

        <h3>Media buyer contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for media professionals. Programmatic directors, trading desk leads, media planners, media buyers, and agency leadership. The people who evaluate and buy adtech platforms.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for media contacts.</p>

        <h3>Agency hierarchy mapping</h3>
        <p>We map holding company to network to agency relationships. You'll know that Mindshare is part of GroupM which is part of WPP. This enables targeted campaigns at any level of the hierarchy.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete agency hierarchy data enabling strategic account planning.</p>

        <h3>Advertising spend signals</h3>
        <p>Estimated ad spend from public sources and industry databases. Digital spend breakdowns where available. Hiring signals that indicate advertising investment. These help you qualify accounts by spend potential.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Ad spend estimates and investment signals for qualification.</p>

        <h3>Agency-client relationships</h3>
        <p>Known agency-client relationships from public sources. Account wins and losses. This helps you understand which brands an agency handles and personalize your approach accordingly.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Client roster data where publicly available.</p>

        <h3>Brand marketing teams</h3>
        <p>For selling direct to brands, we identify marketing leadership: CMOs, VPs of Media, heads of programmatic, and performance marketing leads. Both in-house teams and their agency counterparts.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Brand-side marketing contacts for direct advertiser sales.</p>

        <h2>What AdTech Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach media buyers directly.</strong> With verified contact info for programmatic directors and media planners, you connect with decision-makers instead of getting lost in agency switchboards.</li>
          <li><strong>Target at the right level.</strong> Agency hierarchy data lets you decide whether to approach at the holding company, network, or agency level depending on your solution.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by spend potential.</strong> Ad spend signals help you prioritize agencies and brands that have the budget for your platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize with client context.</strong> Knowing an agency's client roster lets you position around specific brand needs and use cases.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread across agency and brand.</strong> With both agency and brand contacts, you can coordinate approaches across the buying relationship.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Agency names, brand names, whatever accounts you're targeting. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Media contacts? Agency hierarchies? Spend data? Client relationships? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What media buyer data can you enrich?</h3>
          <p>We enrich contact records with verified work emails, direct phone numbers, job titles, and LinkedIn profiles. For adtech sales, we focus on media planners, buyers, programmatic directors, trading desk leads, and agency leadership.</p>

          <h3>Can you provide advertising spend data?</h3>
          <p>We provide estimated ad spend from public sources and industry databases. This includes digital spend estimates, media mix data, and hiring signals that indicate advertising investment.</p>

          <h3>Do you have agency hierarchy and client roster data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We enrich with agency hierarchy data and known agency-client relationships where publicly available. This helps you understand which brands an agency handles.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from using LinkedIn?</h3>
          <p>LinkedIn shows names and titles but not direct contact information. We provide verified emails and direct dials for media buyers, combined with agency hierarchy and spend data.</p>

          <h3>What about independent agencies?</h3>
          <p>Coverage spans both holding company agencies and independents. For larger independents like Horizon or PMG, we typically achieve similar enrichment rates as holding company agencies.</p>
