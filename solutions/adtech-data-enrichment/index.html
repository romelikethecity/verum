        <h2>The AdTech Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's campaign launch day. Your programmatic team has built segments based on your customer data. Job titles, company sizes, industries. The targeting looks precise on paper.</p>

        <p>Two weeks later, the results come in. Click-through rates are half what you projected. Conversion rates are worse. Your data partner shrugs. Your client asks hard questions. Someone pulls a sample and discovers that 30% of the "CMOs" in your segment changed jobs in the last year. The titles are wrong. The companies are wrong. The whole foundation was rotten.</p>

        <p>This happens more than anyone in adtech wants to admit.</p>

        <h3>Audience data decays faster than campaigns refresh</h3>
        <p>B2B contact data degrades at roughly 30% per year. Job changes, company changes, retirements, promotions. Your carefully built segments from six months ago are already significantly stale. The CMO you're targeting might be a VP somewhere else now. The company that fit your ICP might have been acquired.</p>

        <h3>Third-party data is getting harder to trust</h3>
        <p>Cookie deprecation isn't just a Chrome story anymore. Privacy regulations are tightening everywhere. The third-party data providers you relied on for years are scrambling to adapt. Their data quality is suffering. Meanwhile, your campaigns still need to hit numbers.</p>

        <h3>First-party data is messy</h3>
        <p>Everyone says first-party data is the answer. And it is. But most adtech companies have years of accumulated customer and prospect data that's never been properly cleaned. Duplicates everywhere. Outdated contacts. Companies that merged or went out of business. You can't build good segments on a bad foundation.</p>

        <h3>Identity resolution is only as good as your inputs</h3>
        <p>All those fancy identity graphs and cross-device matching tools? They amplify whatever data quality issues you already have. Bad data in, confidently wrong outputs out. The algorithms don't know your contact list is 30% stale. They just keep matching against bad records.</p>

        <p>Every impression served to the wrong person is money wasted. Every campaign built on decayed segments is a client relationship at risk. The adtech companies winning right now are the ones with clean data foundations.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves AdTech Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a data science team just to know if your audience segments are accurate. Verum takes your first-party data, your customer lists, your CRM exports, and makes them usable for precise targeting. We cross-reference, verify, and enrich. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating titles, and verifying company information. We catch the 30% annual decay before it tanks your campaign performance.</p>
        <p><strong>For adtech teams:</strong> Build segments on data you can trust. Know that the CMOs in your targeting are actually still CMOs.</p>

        <h3>First-Party Data Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Your CRM has email addresses. Maybe job titles. We add company size, industry, technology stack, funding stage, and dozens of other attributes that make targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For adtech teams:</strong> Turn basic contact lists into rich audience profiles. Target by firmographics without buying third-party data that might disappear.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication and Identity Resolution</h3>
        <p>Same person, three records. Same company, five variations of the name. We merge and deduplicate so your reach and frequency calculations actually mean something.</p>
        <p><strong>For adtech teams:</strong> Stop showing the same person ads six times because they're in your system six times. Get accurate audience counts.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Adtech targeting requires precision. "Pretty good" data makes for mediocre campaigns.</p>

        <h2>What AdTech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Build segments that actually perform.</strong> When your underlying data is accurate, your targeting works. CTRs go up. Conversions follow. Clients renew.</li>

          <li><strong>Prepare for the cookieless future.</strong> Clean first-party data is your competitive moat. While others scramble for alternatives, you'll have a solid foundation already built.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce wasted ad spend.</strong> Stop serving impressions to people who left their jobs. Stop targeting companies that no longer fit your ICP. Every dollar goes further.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve identity resolution accuracy.</strong> Clean inputs mean clean outputs from your identity graph. Cross-device matching works better when the underlying data is right.</li>

          <li><strong>Prove ROI to clients.</strong> When campaigns perform because targeting is precise, clients stick around. Clean data is a retention strategy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. DMP? CDP? CRM? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 30% annual decay, audience data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes before major campaigns. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About AdTech Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any system.</p>

          <h3>Can you help with first-party data strategies?</h3>
          <p>Yes. As third-party cookies disappear, first-party data becomes critical. We clean and enrich the customer data you already have so your segments and targeting remain effective without relying on third-party sources.</p>

          <h3>What formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>Whatever your systems export. CSV, JSON, database exports. If your DMP or CDP can export it, we can clean it. We'll return it in whatever format you need for import.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new audience names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of customer data that's become a mess? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before a big campaign, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about privacy compliance?</h3>
          <p>We work with business contact data, not consumer PII. Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We understand adtech privacy requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with adtech startups and enterprise platforms. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of scale. A segment with 10,000 contacts has the same decay issues as one with 10 million.</p>
