        <h2>The E-commerce Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>E-commerce is everywhere. Millions of online stores, from one-person Etsy shops to enterprise retailers doing billions. Your addressable market looks enormous. But most of those accounts will never be customers.</p>

        <p>A DTC brand on Shopify evaluates technology completely differently than a B2B distributor on Magento. A company doing $5M GMV with self-fulfillment has different needs than one doing $50M with 3PL partners. The signals that predict e-commerce buying aren't obvious.</p>

        <p>Traditional firmographics don't work. Employee count doesn't correlate with GMV. Industry vertical doesn't reveal platform choice. You need analysis that understands how e-commerce companies actually operate and buy.</p>

        <h3>Platform type shapes everything</h3>
        <p>Shopify stores have different integration needs than BigCommerce or WooCommerce shops. Enterprise platforms like Salesforce Commerce Cloud or SAP Hybris have different buying processes. Your wins cluster around specific platforms. Your data reveals which ones.</p>

        <h3>GMV is the real sizing metric</h3>
        <p>A 10-person company doing $50M in sales has completely different needs than a 100-person company doing $5M. In e-commerce, transaction volume matters more than headcount. GMV bands correlate with operational complexity, budget, and urgency.</p>

        <h3>Fulfillment model drives complexity</h3>
        <p>Self-fulfilled operations have different inventory and shipping challenges than 3PL users. Amazon FBA sellers have marketplace-specific needs. Dropship models have supplier management complexity. Fulfillment model predicts what problems hurt most.</p>

        <h2>What E-commerce Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not generic e-commerce trends. Insights specific to your wins and losses.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Platform Type</h3>
        <p>Which e-commerce platforms are your best customers on? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across platform types to identify where you have product-market fit.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Shopify Plus merchants have 2.5x higher win rates than BigCommerce Enterprise. However, BigCommerce customers have 40% higher expansion rates post-implementation."</p>

        <h3>GMV Band Correlation</h3>
        <p>What transaction volume is your sweet spot? We analyze how GMV correlates with deal success, implementation complexity, and long-term customer value.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Merchants doing $10M-$50M GMV have the best LTV-to-CAC ratio. Below $10M, churn is too high due to business failure. Above $50M, enterprise procurement slows deals."</p>

        <h3>Fulfillment Model Analysis</h3>
        <p>Does your product resonate more with certain fulfillment approaches? We analyze how fulfillment model correlates with your success metrics.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "3PL users close 50% faster than self-fulfilled merchants because they're already outsourcing operations. But self-fulfilled merchants have 30% higher LTV."</p>

        <h3>Business Model Segmentation</h3>
        <p>DTC brands, B2B distributors, marketplaces, omnichannel retailers. We analyze which business models drive the best outcomes for your specific solution.</p>
        <p><strong>Example output:</strong> "Pure DTC brands have highest win rates but highest churn. Omnichannel retailers have longer sales cycles but 3x better retention. Adjust targeting and forecasting accordingly."</p>

        <h2>E-commerce-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Platform type.</strong> Shopify/Shopify Plus, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Magento, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, custom builds. Platform choice signals technical sophistication and integration patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>GMV bands.</strong> $1M-$5M, $5M-$10M, $10M-$50M, $50M-$100M, $100M+. Transaction volume correlates with operational complexity, budget authority, and decision urgency.</li>

          <li><strong>Fulfillment model.</strong> Self-fulfilled, 3PL, FBA/marketplace fulfillment, dropship, hybrid. Fulfillment approach affects operational pain points and integration requirements.</li>

          <li><strong>Business model.</strong> DTC, B2B e-commerce, marketplace, omnichannel retail, wholesale. Business model drives feature requirements and buying process.</li>

          <li><strong>Channel mix.</strong> Single-channel vs multi-channel, marketplace presence (Amazon, Walmart, etc.), social commerce adoption. Channel complexity affects integration needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth trajectory.</strong> Hypergrowth DTC, stable established retailer, declining legacy business. Growth stage affects urgency, budget, and solution fit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your e-commerce market position, product category, and the questions you need answered about your ideal customer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible and what enrichment might strengthen insights.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across e-commerce-specific dimensions. Platform type, GMV correlation, fulfillment model, business model. The analysis is built around how online retailers buy technology.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which platforms to focus on, what GMV bands to target, how to adjust messaging by segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring models, and sales playbook adjustments.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What e-commerce data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your e-commerce sales data to identify your ideal customer profile by platform type, GMV bands, and fulfillment model. We segment accounts by likelihood to buy and expand, predict churn, and find patterns specific to online retail buyers.</p>

          <h3>How do you segment e-commerce companies by GMV?</h3>
          <p>We classify e-commerce companies by gross merchandise value bands that correlate with different operational needs and buying behaviors. A $1M GMV brand has very different challenges than a $100M one. We analyze how your wins correlate with GMV bands to identify your sweet spot.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze fulfillment model as a buying signal?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Self-fulfilled, 3PL, FBA, dropship, and hybrid fulfillment models create different operational complexities, integration needs, and technology requirements. We help you understand which fulfillment models drive the best outcomes for your business.</p>

          <h3>What about seasonality in e-commerce buying?</h3>
          <p>E-commerce has strong seasonal patterns. We analyze whether your wins correlate with seasonal preparation cycles (pre-Q4 rush, post-holiday optimization) to help you time outreach effectively.</p>
