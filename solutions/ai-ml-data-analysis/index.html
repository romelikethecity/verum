        <h2>The AI/ML Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>The AI/ML market exploded. Every company now claims AI capabilities. Your TAM looks massive on paper. But most of those companies aren't real buyers for what you sell.</p>

        <p>Some are research teams with no production roadmap. Others are startups burning through runway with no path to revenue. Some have massive compute budgets but buy everything through cloud provider marketplaces. The signals that matter aren't obvious.</p>

        <p>Traditional firmographics don't cut it. Employee count doesn't tell you if they're training models or just using APIs. Funding stage doesn't reveal whether they're building ML infrastructure or outsourcing it. You need analysis that understands AI/ML buying patterns.</p>

        <h3>Development stage matters more than company size</h3>
        <p>A 50-person company deploying models in production has very different needs than a 500-person company still experimenting. Research teams, prototype builders, production deployers, and scale optimizers all buy differently. Knowing which stage your best customers are in changes everything.</p>

        <h3>Compute infrastructure signals intent</h3>
        <p>Companies running their own GPU clusters buy differently than those using managed services. On-prem vs cloud vs hybrid deployments create different integration requirements, budget structures, and decision-making processes. Your data reveals these patterns.</p>

        <h3>Research vs production focus</h3>
        <p>Teams publishing papers have different timelines than teams shipping features. Academic-adjacent teams often have longer sales cycles but bigger eventual deals. Production-focused teams move faster but may commoditize quickly. Understanding this split is critical.</p>

        <h2>What AI/ML Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not dashboards for dashboards' sake. Recommendations you can act on Monday morning.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Development Stage</h3>
        <p>Which AI/ML companies convert at the highest rates? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across development stages to identify where you should focus.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Companies in production deployment stage have 4x higher LTV than experimentation-stage companies. They also close 2x faster and expand more predictably."</p>

        <h3>Compute Infrastructure Correlation</h3>
        <p>Does your product sell better to companies with specific infrastructure setups? We identify patterns between compute environment, cloud provider choice, and your win rates.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers running on AWS with managed Kubernetes have 65% higher win rates than those on GCP with custom orchestration. Adjust targeting and messaging accordingly."</p>

        <h3>Research vs Production Segmentation</h3>
        <p>Which focus area drives better outcomes? We separate research-heavy organizations from production-focused teams and analyze how each segment performs.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Production-focused teams close in 3 months on average. Research teams take 9 months but land 3x larger initial contracts. Both are viable ICPs with different motions."</p>

        <h3>Technical Buyer Pattern Analysis</h3>
        <p>ML Engineers, Data Scientists, MLOps Engineers, Platform leads. Which technical buyers correlate with closed deals? We identify the personas that matter most.</p>
        <p><strong>Example output:</strong> "Deals with MLOps Engineer involvement close at 2.5x the rate of Data Scientist-only deals. Shift ABM focus to MLOps titles."</p>

        <h2>AI/ML-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Development stage.</strong> Research/experimentation, prototype/POC, production deployment, scale/optimization. Each stage has distinct buying behaviors and budget authority.</li>

          <li><strong>Compute infrastructure.</strong> On-prem GPU clusters, cloud instances, managed ML services, hybrid setups. Infrastructure choices reveal technical maturity and integration complexity.</li>

          <li><strong>Research vs production focus.</strong> Academic partnerships, paper publishing cadence, production deployment frequency, MLOps investment. These factors predict sales cycle length and deal structure.</li>

          <li><strong>Model type and use case.</strong> LLM/NLP, computer vision, recommendation systems, forecasting. Different model types often correlate with different buying patterns and expansion potential.</li>

          <li><strong>Team composition.</strong> ML Engineer to Data Scientist ratio, presence of MLOps titles, platform engineering investment. Team structure signals maturity and buying authority.</li>

          <li><strong>Funding and runway.</strong> For startups, funding stage and burn rate matter. But the signal is more nuanced than just "Series B = good." We analyze how funding correlates with your specific wins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your AI/ML market position, current segmentation approach, and the questions keeping you up at night.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible given your data and any enrichment needed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across AI/ML-specific dimensions. Development stage classification, compute patterns, research vs production signals. The analysis is built around what makes AI/ML companies different.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to double down on, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict success in AI/ML sales.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring adjustments, and resource allocation changes. Not a PDF that sits on a shelf.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What AI/ML data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your AI/ML sales data to identify your ideal customer profile by development stage, compute infrastructure, and research vs production focus. We segment accounts by likelihood to buy and expand, predict churn, and find patterns in win/loss data specific to AI companies.</p>

          <h3>How do you segment AI companies by development stage?</h3>
          <p>We classify AI companies by their maturity: research/experimentation stage, prototype/POC stage, production deployment stage, and scale/optimization stage. Each stage has dramatically different buying behaviors, budget authority, and solution requirements.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze research-focused vs production-focused AI teams?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Research teams (academic partnerships, R&D focus, paper-driven) and production teams (MLOps focus, inference optimization, deployment pipelines) have very different needs and buying patterns. We help you understand which type drives better outcomes for your business.</p>

          <h3>What if we sell to both AI-native companies and enterprises adopting AI?</h3>
          <p>That's a common scenario. We analyze both segments separately to identify whether your ICP skews toward AI-native startups or enterprise AI initiatives. Often the answer is more nuanced than expected.</p>
