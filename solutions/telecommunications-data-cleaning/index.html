        <h2>The Telecommunications Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Whether you're selling to carriers or selling telecom solutions to enterprises, you're dealing with one of the most complex industries for data. Carrier hierarchies are confusing. M&A activity constantly changes the landscape. And regional variations make standardization challenging.</p>

        <p>Telecom has unique data challenges. The same carrier might appear as "AT&T" and "AT&T Wireless" and "AT&T Business" in your CRM. Are those the same account? Different divisions? Regional carriers get acquired and rebranded. Contacts move between carriers or shift roles entirely. Your database accumulates complexity over time.</p>

        <h3>Carrier names are inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"Verizon" and "VZW" and "Verizon Wireless" and "Verizon Business" and "Verizon Enterprise Solutions" might all be in your CRM. Your account counts are wrong. ABM campaigns target the same carrier multiple times. Reporting doesn't make sense.</p>

        <h3>M&A creates orphaned records</h3>
        <p>Sprint was acquired by T-Mobile. Regional carriers get bought by national players. Your CRM has contacts at companies that don't exist under those names anymore. You're emailing people at outdated company domains.</p>

        <h3>Contact turnover is significant</h3>
        <p>Telecom has cycles of layoffs, restructuring, and rehiring. The VP of Network Operations you knew might have been part of a reduction. Or moved to a competitor. Your database has contacts who've left but you don't know it.</p>

        <h3>Regional and international complexity</h3>
        <p>Carriers operate differently in different regions. International carriers have complex subsidiary structures. Your database might have the same carrier listed under different regional names without proper hierarchy linkage.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Telecom Data</h2>

        <p>We understand telecommunications industry structure. Carrier hierarchies. Operating company relationships. The difference between selling to carriers versus selling telecom to enterprises.</p>

        <h3>Carrier hierarchy standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize carrier names and map proper hierarchies. All Verizon entities connect correctly. All T-Mobile and former Sprint entities are properly attributed. Your account structure reflects reality.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized carrier names with hierarchy relationships mapped.</p>

        <h3>M&A-aware deduplication</h3>
        <p>We track carrier mergers and acquisitions. Records at acquired carriers get flagged. Company names get updated where appropriate. You stop reaching out to people at carriers that no longer exist.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Deduplicated contacts with acquisition status noted.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that contacts are still at the companies and in the roles you expect. Telecom restructuring creates stale data. We flag contacts who've moved and validate email deliverability.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails with job change flags.</p>

        <h3>Regional normalization</h3>
        <p>We standardize carrier data across regions, handling international naming conventions and subsidiary relationships. Your global carrier data becomes consistent and usable.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Regionally consistent carrier data ready for global sales and marketing.</p>

        <h2>What Telecom Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run carrier ABM effectively.</strong> When carrier hierarchies are mapped, you can coordinate campaigns across divisions or target specific operating companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop chasing outdated carriers.</strong> M&A tracking means you're not pursuing contacts at carriers that no longer exist.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce email bounces.</strong> Validated emails protect your sender reputation and improve campaign performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline metrics.</strong> When carriers are properly attributed, your revenue reporting by account actually makes sense.</li>
          <li><strong>Track industry movement.</strong> Job change tracking shows you where your contacts have landed after restructuring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contacts and accounts from your CRM. We work with exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, carrier hierarchy issues, M&A impacts, and contact validation. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, hierarchy mapping, M&A updates, validation. Human review on complex carrier relationships. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle carrier company hierarchies?</h3>
          <p>We understand the relationships between telecom holding companies, operating companies, regional carriers, and MVNOs. We standardize names and map hierarchies correctly.</p>

          <p>Yes. Whether you're selling to carriers or selling telecom solutions to enterprises, we understand the different data challenges and handle both appropriately.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle carrier M&A and consolidation?</h3>
          <p>We track carrier acquisitions and mergers, flagging records that need updating. Contacts at acquired carriers get flagged and company attribution updated where appropriate.</p>

          <h3>How long does telecom data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most telecommunications CRM cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Complex hierarchy mapping may take 3-5 business days.</p>

          <h3>What about international carriers?</h3>
          <p>We have coverage for major international carriers and understand regional naming conventions. Coverage varies by region, and we'll give you expected match rates for your specific list.</p>
