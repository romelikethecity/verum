        <h2>The Healthcare Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to hospitals, health systems, and physician practices. Your CRM has 20,000 contacts. But how many of those are still accurate?</p>

        <p>Healthcare has one of the highest contact turnover rates of any industry. Physicians change health systems. Administrators rotate roles. Entire hospitals get acquired and consolidated. The provider who was your champion last year might not even work there anymore.</p>

        <h3>Provider turnover creates chaos</h3>
        <p>The average physician changes employers every 6-8 years, but healthcare administrators move even faster. CMIOs, CIOs, and department heads cycle through roles as health systems restructure. Every departure leaves a stale record in your CRM that wastes sales effort and hurts deliverability.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates multiply across systems</h3>
        <p>Your marketing team imports a conference list. Sales adds contacts from a trade show. Someone uploads a purchased list without deduping first. Now you've got three records for the same CMIO, each with slightly different information. Your sales rep doesn't know which one to trust, and your email platform might be sending to all three.</p>

        <h3>Health system consolidation scrambles everything</h3>
        <p>When hospitals merge or join health systems, contacts don't update themselves. That independent hospital in your CRM is now part of a larger system. The decision-maker changed. The email domain changed. The purchasing process changed. Your data didn't.</p>

        <h3>NPI data gets messy</h3>
        <p>NPI numbers should be unique identifiers, but they're only useful if they're correct. Typos during data entry, deactivated NPIs for retired providers, NPIs associated with the wrong individual. Bad NPI data breaks your provider verification workflows and creates compliance headaches.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See What's Wrong With Your Data</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Healthcare Data</h2>

        <p>We don't just run your data through an algorithm and call it done. Healthcare data requires understanding the industry's unique identifiers, organizational structures, and data patterns.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication that understands healthcare</h3>
        <p>Matching on name and email isn't enough. We use NPI numbers, organization affiliations, and role patterns to identify true duplicates even when contact details differ. Dr. Smith at Memorial Hospital and John Smith MD at Memorial Health System might be the same person. We figure that out.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> A single golden record for each contact with the most current information, plus a merge report showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Email validation with healthcare context</h3>
        <p>We verify every email address is deliverable, but we also flag healthcare-specific patterns. Generic emails like info@hospital.com that won't reach your contact. Personal gmail addresses that might indicate the provider left. Domain changes from acquisitions that haven't propagated yet.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Validated emails with confidence scores, flagged risky addresses, and recommendations for records that need manual review.</p>

        <h3>NPI verification and correction</h3>
        <p>We check every NPI against the NPPES registry. Is it valid? Is it active? Does it match the provider name in your record? We catch deactivated NPIs, typos, and mismatches that break your provider verification workflows.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Verified NPI data with flags for any records that don't match registry information.</p>

        <h3>Standardization for healthcare fields</h3>
        <p>Provider titles, specialty names, organization types. Healthcare has its own vocabulary. We standardize "Chief Medical Information Officer" and "CMIO" and "Chief Medical Informatics Officer" into a consistent format your systems can actually use for segmentation.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent formatting across titles, specialties, organization types, and addresses.</p>

        <h2>What Healthcare Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Launch campaigns with confidence.</strong> When you know your emails will actually reach the right people, you can focus on messaging instead of worrying about bounce rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop wasting sales effort.</strong> No more reps calling contacts who left two years ago or emailing into the void. Every touch goes to a real person at the right organization.</li>
          <li><strong>Segment accurately.</strong> Clean titles and organization types mean your health system campaign goes to health systems and your independent hospital campaign goes to independent hospitals.</li>
          <li><strong>Merge CRMs without disaster.</strong> Acquisitions, platform migrations, consolidating regional databases. Clean data first means fewer headaches after.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your reporting.</strong> When duplicates are gone and data is standardized, your pipeline reports and win rate analysis actually mean something.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, or whatever you're using. CSV, Excel, whatever format works. We'll sign an NDA if you need one.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze it.</strong> Before we quote, we look at what you've got. How many records? What's the duplicate rate? How bad is the decay? We'll tell you what we find, even if you don't hire us.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization, NPI verification. Human review on anything that needs judgment. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get clean data back.</strong> Import-ready file with cleaning notes, a summary of what we fixed, and recommendations for ongoing maintenance.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle HIPAA when cleaning healthcare data?</h3>
          <p>We clean B2B contact data for healthcare sales and marketing teams, not patient data. This includes provider contact information, hospital administrator details, and business emails. We don't process PHI or patient records. Our process focuses on firmographic and contact data that helps you sell to healthcare organizations.</p>

          <h3>Can you validate NPI numbers during the cleaning process?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We verify NPI numbers against the NPPES registry and flag records where the NPI doesn't match the provider name or has been deactivated. This catches issues like providers who've retired, changed organizations, or have incorrect NPI associations in your CRM.</p>

          <h3>How long does healthcare data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most healthcare data cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for files under 50,000 records. Larger datasets or complex deduplication across multiple systems may take 3-5 business days. We'll give you a timeline estimate after reviewing your data.</p>

          <h3>What's the difference between data cleaning and data enrichment?</h3>
          <p>Data cleaning fixes what you already have: removing duplicates, validating emails, standardizing formats, correcting errors. Data enrichment adds new information you don't have: filling in missing phone numbers, adding company size, appending technology stack data. Most healthcare teams need both, but cleaning comes first.</p>

          <h3>What if my data is really bad?</h3>
          <p>We've seen it all. 40% duplicate rates. Records from 2015 that haven't been touched since. Five different CRMs merged without any deduplication. Bad data is why we exist. We'll tell you honestly what's fixable and what might need to be rebuilt from scratch.</p>
        </div>
