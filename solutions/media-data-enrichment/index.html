        <h2>The Media Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's upfront season. Your ad sales team is reaching out to agencies and brands with next year's inventory. Relationships you've built over years. Premium placements. Strong packages.</p>

        <p>Except the media buyer you've been working with moved to a different agency. The brand contact who approved last year's buy switched companies. The agency that handled your biggest account lost the business and you didn't know. Your outreach is hitting inboxes of people who can't buy anymore.</p>

        <p>The ad industry moves fast. Your data isn't keeping up.</p>

        <h3>Agency turnover reshuffles your contacts constantly</h3>
        <p>Agencies have notoriously high turnover. Media buyers, planners, and account leads jump between agencies regularly. The buyer you knew at one agency might be at a competitor next quarter. Or in-house at a brand. Or out of the industry entirely. Your CRM reflects relationships that may no longer exist.</p>

        <h3>Brand-agency relationships shift without notice</h3>
        <p>Accounts get reviewed. Agencies win and lose business. The agency handling your biggest advertiser's media might not have that account anymore. You're pitching to the wrong people because nobody told you the relationship changed.</p>

        <h3>Brand-side marketing teams restructure often</h3>
        <p>Budget cuts, reorgs, in-housing, outsourcing. The brand-side marketing leader who approved direct buys might be gone. Their replacement might want to run everything through an agency. Your direct relationships need constant updating.</p>

        <h3>Contact data fragments across properties</h3>
        <p>If you're selling across multiple media properties, you might have different contact data in each system. The same agency relationship shows up differently in digital, broadcast, and print databases. No single view of the relationship.</p>

        <p>Every email to someone who left is an opportunity missed. Every pitch to an agency that lost the account is time wasted. Every relationship you don't know about is revenue going to competitors. In a market measured in billions, clean data isn't optional.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Media Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a research team to know which buyers still have budget authority. Verum takes your advertiser databases, agency contacts, and CRM exports, and makes them current. We verify contacts, track role changes, and enrich account data. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating titles, and verifying current employers. We catch the agency hopping before your team pitches to empty seats.</p>
        <p><strong>For media teams:</strong> Know when your buyer moves to a new agency. Stop pitching to people who can't sign anymore.</p>

        <h3>Relationship Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Agency-brand relationships change. We help you track which agencies handle which accounts so your pitches go to the right place.</p>
        <p><strong>For media teams:</strong> Don't pitch an agency for a brand they lost. Know who's managing the media spend before you reach out.</p>

        <h3>Account Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing advertiser details? Industry vertical? Estimated ad spend? We fill in the gaps that make account prioritization work.</p>
        <p><strong>For media teams:</strong> Focus on accounts with real budget. Know which advertisers are increasing spend versus cutting.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But media data has complexity. Holding companies, agency networks, brand portfolios. Every file gets human review before delivery.</p>

        <h2>What Media Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Improve upfront and scatter sales efficiency.</strong> When your contact data is accurate, pitches land with people who can actually buy. Less time chasing, more time closing.</li>

          <li><strong>Track buyers across agencies.</strong> When a good buyer moves to a new agency, that's a relationship you want to maintain. Clean data lets you follow people, not just job titles.</li>

          <li><strong>Know who controls the budget.</strong> Agency versus brand-direct. Media director versus CMO. Understanding the decision-making structure means knowing who to pitch.</li>

          <li><strong>Prioritize by spending potential.</strong> Enriched data helps you focus on accounts with real budgets and active campaigns, not companies that cut their ad spend.</li>

          <li><strong>Unify data across properties.</strong> One view of each advertiser relationship across all your media properties. No more fragmented account data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your systems, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? Custom CRM? Spreadsheets? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Agency contacts change constantly. We can run quarterly refreshes before major selling seasons. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Why Media Leaders Choose Verum</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>We do the work.</strong> This isn't another platform to learn. Send us your data, get clean data back. Your team stays focused on selling inventory.</li>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Clean your data before upfronts, not during.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Every project gets both.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Project-based pricing fits media sales cycles.</li>

          <li><strong>We understand media.</strong> The difference between a media buyer and a planner. Holding companies versus independents. Brand-direct versus agency. We know the domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About Media Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any system.</p>

          <h3>Can you help track agency-brand relationships?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can enrich your data with account relationships where that information is publicly available. Know which agencies handle which brands before you pitch.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with both agency and brand-side contacts?</h3>
          <p>We work across the advertising ecosystem. Agency media buyers, brand marketing leads, production companies, whatever contacts you're selling to. If they buy media, we can help you reach them.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of advertiser relationships and that data is stale? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before upfronts, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. Your advertiser relationships are competitive intelligence.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with media companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with niche publishers and major broadcast networks. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of inventory scale.</p>
