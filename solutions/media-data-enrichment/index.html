        <h2>The Media Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to media and entertainment companies. Publishers, streamers, studios, gaming companies. Your buyers are busy executives who get pitched constantly. Generic outreach doesn't work. You need precise targeting and relevant positioning.</p>

        <p>Media buyer data has unique challenges. Executive contact information is protected. Audience and reach metrics help qualify but are scattered across sources. The line between editorial and business decisions varies by company. And media is in constant flux, with properties launching, merging, and shutting down constantly.</p>

        <h3>Business-side contacts are hard to reach</h3>
        <p>You want to reach the CRO, CPO, or Head of Ad Ops. Not the editorial contacts that are published everywhere. Business decision-makers at media companies protect their time and contact information.</p>

        <h3>Audience data helps qualification</h3>
        <p>A publisher with 50M monthly visitors has different needs than one with 500K. Audience size and composition affect deal size and fit. But this data is scattered across analytics platforms and press releases.</p>

        <h3>Property hierarchies matter</h3>
        <p>Are you selling to the individual publication or the parent company? Where do decisions get made? You need to understand conglomerate structures to know who to approach and at what level.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack indicates fit</h3>
        <p>What CMS do they use? What ad server? What video platform? If you're selling media technology, knowing their current stack is essential for positioning. But media companies don't advertise their tech infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that media sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage publishers and entertainment companies.</p>

        <h3>Business-side contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for media business decision-makers. CROs, CPOs, VPs of Ad Sales, Heads of Product, Technology leaders. The people who buy media technology and services.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for business contacts.</p>

        <h3>Buying committee mapping</h3>
        <p>We identify the full stakeholder group for technology purchases. Revenue, product, engineering, ad operations, and finance stakeholders. You'll know who's involved in buying decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multi-contact enrichment showing the buying committee at target properties.</p>

        <h3>Audience and reach data</h3>
        <p>Monthly visitors, social following, audience demographics, and content focus from public sources. This helps you qualify properties by reach and fit.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Audience metrics for qualification and prioritization.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack</h3>
        <p>CMS, ad tech, video platforms, analytics tools, and other media infrastructure. We identify what technologies media companies are using so you can qualify fit and position appropriately.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data for media-specific technologies.</p>

        <h3>Conglomerate mapping</h3>
        <p>We map properties to parent companies and identify where decisions get made. Understand whether to approach at the property level or corporate level.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Property-to-parent mapping for strategic account planning.</p>

        <h2>What Media Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach business decision-makers.</strong> With verified contact info for revenue and product executives, you connect with buyers instead of editorial contacts.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by audience size.</strong> Reach data lets you instantly qualify whether a property is in your target tier.</li>
          <li><strong>Position to current stack.</strong> Tech stack data helps you position against existing solutions and identify integration opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Approach at the right level.</strong> Conglomerate mapping tells you whether to sell at the property or corporate level.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread across functions.</strong> With the full buying committee mapped, engage revenue, product, and technology simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>
