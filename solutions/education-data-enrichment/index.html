        <h2>The Education Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling edtech, curriculum, services, or products to schools and universities. Your CRM has institution names and maybe a main office number. That's not enough to run an effective education sales motion.</p>

        <p>Education buyer data is challenging. Administrator turnover is high. Decision-making authority varies by institution. Budget cycles and procurement processes differ. Your SDRs spend hours researching each school before they can start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>Administrators are hard to reach</h3>
        <p>Principals and department heads are busy. School office staff screens calls. District offices protect superintendent time. Without direct contact information, you're not reaching the decision-makers who evaluate and purchase.</p>

        <h3>Institution data is incomplete</h3>
        <p>Enrollment size matters for pricing and fit. Budget data indicates purchasing capacity. Title I status signals funding availability. But this institution-level data isn't in your CRM.</p>

        <h3>Decision-makers vary by institution</h3>
        <p>At small schools, the principal decides. At larger schools, there are department heads and coordinators. At districts, there are central office administrators. Understanding who makes decisions for your product type at each institution requires research.</p>

        <h3>Technology and curriculum data is hidden</h3>
        <p>What LMS do they use? What curriculum? If you're selling edtech, knowing their current stack is essential for qualification and competitive positioning. But schools don't advertise their technology choices.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the data that edtech and education services companies need to identify, qualify, and engage schools and districts effectively.</p>

        <h3>Administrator contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for the people who buy for schools. Principals, superintendents, curriculum directors, technology coordinators, department chairs, deans. The contacts that get you into education opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct contacts where available for target administrators.</p>

        <h3>Institution firmographics</h3>
        <p>Enrollment count, grade levels, Title I status, public/private/charter classification, and district affiliation. Understanding institution characteristics helps you qualify opportunities and tier accounts appropriately.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete institution profiles enabling accurate qualification and segmentation.</p>

        <h3>Budget and spending indicators</h3>
        <p>Technology spending signals, federal funding indicators, and budget data where publicly available. Understanding purchasing capacity helps you prioritize institutions with budget for your solution.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Budget signals enabling prioritization of high-potential opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Technology and curriculum data</h3>
        <p>LMS platforms, SIS systems, major curriculum adoptions, and technology infrastructure where detectable. We identify what systems schools are running so you can qualify fit and position against competitors.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data enabling competitive positioning and relevant outreach.</p>

        <h3>Leadership change signals</h3>
        <p>New superintendent hires, principal changes, and administrator transitions. Leadership changes often trigger purchasing decisions and policy reviews. We provide signals that indicate institutions in transition.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Leadership change data enabling timely, relevant outreach.</p>

        <h2>What Education Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach decision-makers directly.</strong> With verified administrator contacts, you're reaching principals and coordinators instead of getting lost in school office voicemail.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by institution size.</strong> Enrollment data lets you tier schools appropriately. Large districts get enterprise treatment. Small schools get efficient outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize by budget signals.</strong> Title I status and spending indicators help you focus on institutions with purchasing capacity.</li>
          <li><strong>Target technology transitions.</strong> Knowing current LMS and SIS helps you identify replacement opportunities and position competitively.</li>
          <li><strong>Time outreach to changes.</strong> New superintendent? Perfect time to introduce your solution before they lock in vendor relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> School names, district names, whatever institutions you're targeting. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched institutions immediately.</p>
