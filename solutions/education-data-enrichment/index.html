        <h2>The Education Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's annual fund season. Your development team is preparing the big fall appeal. Direct mail to 50,000 alumni. Email campaigns. Phonathon scripts. The goal is ambitious but achievable. If people actually get your messages.</p>

        <p>Last year's appeal came back with 4,000 undeliverable mailers. The email campaign had a 22% bounce rate. The phonathon team spent more time listening to disconnected number messages than talking to actual alumni. Your "lost alumni" file keeps growing.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, you know there are successful graduates out there who would give if you could just reach them.</p>

        <h3>Alumni scatter after graduation</h3>
        <p>Students leave with their college email and maybe a home address. Within a year, both are probably outdated. Within five years, they've moved twice, changed jobs three times, and gotten married (or divorced). The contact info in your database reflects who they were at 22, not who they are now.</p>

        <h3>Decades of accumulated data decay</h3>
        <p>A university with 40 years of alumni has records that span the landline era to the smartphone age. Some records have addresses but no email. Others have email but the person hasn't checked that inbox since Gmail launched. Contact data decays at roughly 30% per year. Multiply that across decades and the problem compounds.</p>

        <h3>Major gift prospects hide in bad data</h3>
        <p>Your highest potential donors might be sitting in your database with wrong contact info. That alumnus who just made partner at a major firm? You're still sending mail to their parents' house. The entrepreneur who sold a company? You don't even know they changed industries. Wealth is meaningless without reachability.</p>

        <h3>Enrollment marketing needs accurate prospect data too</h3>
        <p>It's not just alumni. Prospective student data goes stale fast. High schoolers change their minds, move, get new phone numbers. The inquiry you got in September might be unreachable by April decision time. Every unreachable prospect is an enrollment opportunity lost.</p>

        <p>Every undeliverable appeal is money you didn't raise. Every bounced email is an engagement opportunity missed. Every disconnected phone number is an alumnus who might have given if you'd just reached them. Your competitors with clean data are raising more money with smaller lists.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Education Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a full-time data person just to know which alumni are reachable. Verum takes your constituent database, your alumni lists, your prospect files, and makes them accurate. We find current contact information, verify addresses, and enrich records. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Discovery and Verification</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your records against 50+ data sources, finding current emails, phone numbers, and addresses. We verify deliverability before you spend money on mailings that come back.</p>
        <p><strong>For education teams:</strong> Turn your "lost alumni" file into reachable constituents. Stop wasting postage on undeliverable addresses.</p>

        <h3>Career and Employer Updates</h3>
        <p>Know where your alumni work now, not where they worked when they graduated. We append current employer, job title, and LinkedIn profile data that helps your development team identify major gift prospects.</p>
        <p><strong>For education teams:</strong> Find out which alumni have moved into roles with significant giving capacity. Prioritize outreach accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Address Standardization and Verification</h3>
        <p>We validate mailing addresses against postal databases, standardize formatting, and flag records that need attention. No more "current resident" returns.</p>
        <p><strong>For education teams:</strong> Reduce undeliverable mail before it goes out. Better data means better response rates on direct mail appeals.</p>

        <h3>Record Deduplication</h3>
        <p>Same alumnus, three records. One from admissions, one from the registrar, one from a reunion committee. We merge them into a single comprehensive view.</p>
        <p><strong>For education teams:</strong> Stop double-soliciting donors. Know the complete relationship history with each constituent.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before delivery. Education data has nuances. Maiden names, married names, nicknames, prefixes. We catch what algorithms miss.</p>

        <h2>What Education Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Increase annual fund participation.</strong> More reachable alumni means more asks delivered. More asks delivered means more gifts. It's not complicated, just foundational.</li>

          <li><strong>Identify major gift prospects earlier.</strong> Career data reveals which alumni have moved into positions with significant giving capacity. Your gift officers can prioritize intelligently.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce wasted appeal spend.</strong> Every undeliverable mailer costs money. Every bounced email hurts deliverability. Clean data means your development budget actually reaches people.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve reunion attendance.</strong> Reaching more classmates means better reunion turnout. Better turnout means better reunion giving. The class gift improves when people can actually come.</li>

          <li><strong>Reconnect with lost alumni.</strong> That 40% unreachable rate? We can typically recover a significant portion. Every recovered alumnus is a potential donor, volunteer, or mentor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Raiser's Edge? Slate? Banner? We've worked with them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Alumni data needs regular maintenance. We can run annual refreshes before major campaigns. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Education Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. We work with exports from any system.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with our advancement database?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Raiser's Edge, Slate, Banner, PeopleSoft, and most major platforms. If your system can export data, we can clean it. We'll return it in whatever format you need for import.</p>

          <h3>Can you help with alumni wealth screening?</h3>
          <p>We enrich records with career data, employer information, and publicly available signals. We don't provide wealth ratings directly, but we give you the foundation data that makes screening services more accurate and your prospect research more efficient.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells B2B contact databases. If you need net-new corporate contacts, that's their strength. But if you already have decades of alumni data that needs cleaning? That's us. We fix what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data before the capital campaign, pay for that project.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about FERPA compliance?</h3>
          <p>We work with directory information and publicly available data. We don't access protected educational records. Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties. Happy to discuss specific compliance requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with institutions of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with community colleges and major research universities. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of enrollment. An alumni database with 10,000 records has the same decay issues as one with 500,000.</p>
