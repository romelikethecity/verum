        <h2>The Travel & Hospitality Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell technology, services, or partnerships to travel and hospitality companies. Your CRM contains hotel chains, airlines, travel agencies, tour operators, and OTAs. But the travel industry has been through massive disruption.</p>

        <p>That hotel you've been targeting? Changed brand flags last quarter. The GM you built a relationship with? Moved to a different property. The travel agency on your target list? Closed permanently after industry downturns. Your database reflects a travel landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Travel and hospitality data has unique challenges. High employee turnover, property rebranding, and the complexity of ownership versus management structures mean your prospect data goes stale faster than most industries.</p>

        <h3>Properties change brands constantly</h3>
        <p>Hotels switch brand affiliations, join or leave franchise systems, and rebrand after ownership changes. That Marriott in your database might now be a Hilton—or an independent. Your target account list includes properties under names that no longer exist, making your outreach look uninformed.</p>

        <h3>Hospitality turnover is extreme</h3>
        <p>The travel industry has some of the highest turnover rates of any sector. General managers move between properties. Corporate executives change companies. The decision-maker you've been cultivating might be at a completely different company than your CRM shows.</p>

        <h3>Ownership vs. management complexity</h3>
        <p>Who actually makes purchasing decisions? The property owner? The management company? The brand? The same property might have different entities handling different decisions. Your data doesn't capture who controls what.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought hotel databases, airline contact lists, travel agency directories. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different accuracy levels. Now you have the same property or company five times with conflicting information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for travel sales. An industry still recovering from disruption has no patience for vendors who don't know their current situation. You can't afford to waste time pursuing closed properties or departed contacts.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Travel & Hospitality Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy travel database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company and Property Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that hotels and travel companies still operate, flag those that have closed or rebranded, and update records where we can identify current brand affiliations and ownership.</p>
        <p><strong>For travel sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing properties that closed or rebranded. Know current brand flags. Focus on active companies that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when property or company names vary or data came from different sources. We handle brand changes and ownership complexity.</p>
        <p><strong>For travel sales teams:</strong> One clean record per property or company. Clear understanding of brand affiliations. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the properties or companies you think they are. Departures and moves get flagged.</p>
        <p><strong>For travel sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current properties. Know when GMs move. Maintain relationships even as people transition across the industry.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, property types (full-service, select-service, boutique), and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For travel sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by company type and property class. Target luxury hotels differently from economy chains. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Travel & Hospitality Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on active properties.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on hotels that closed or companies that shut down. Every account in your database represents a real business that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track GM and executive moves.</strong> When decision-makers move between properties or companies, you know about it. Maintain relationships even through the industry's high turnover.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by property type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target full-service hotels differently from select-service, airlines differently from OTAs. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate ownership complexity.</strong> Understand which entities make which decisions—owners, management companies, or brands. Know where purchasing authority actually sits.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        Send us a sample of your travel database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Hospitality turnover never stops. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Travel Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of travel data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Hotel databases, airline contacts, travel agency lists, tour operator data, OTA contacts, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the travel and hospitality industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you track hotel ownership changes?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate company names against current data and can flag records where properties have changed brands, ownership, or management companies. This is especially valuable given the complexity of hotel ownership structures.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle the owner vs. management company complexity?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can help clarify ownership and management relationships in your data. Understanding who makes which decisions is part of what we do.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our travel data?</h3>
          <p>Given the high turnover in hospitality, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant industry changes or brand announcements.</p>
