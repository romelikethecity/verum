        <h2>The Travel Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're running a hotel, airline, OTA, or travel service. Your PMS and CRM hold years of guest data from dozens of booking channels. But that data has become fragmented and unreliable.</p>

        <p>Travel data degrades fast. Guests change email addresses, switch jobs (killing corporate contact info), and book through different channels each trip. Loyalty programs create one profile, OTAs create another, and direct bookings create a third. Your team can't deliver personalized experiences when they don't know who's actually walking through the door.</p>

        <h3>Guests exist multiple times</h3>
        <p>The same traveler booked through Expedia last year, your direct site this quarter, and called reservations yesterday. Now you have three profiles with different information. Your loyalty program shows conflicting point balances. Your front desk can't see their full history. Personalization fails.</p>

        <h3>Contact information is outdated</h3>
        <p>Email addresses change. Phone numbers update. Corporate travelers switch companies. Your pre-arrival emails bounce. Your loyalty communications don't reach members. You're marketing to addresses that haven't worked in years.</p>

        <h3>Corporate accounts are stale</h3>
        <p>If you sell to corporate travel managers, your B2B data has the same problems. The travel buyer who signed your contract moved on. The corporate rate contact changed departments. You're maintaining relationships with people who can't actually make purchasing decisions anymore.</p>

        <h3>Property and partner data is inconsistent</h3>
        <p>For hotel groups and OTAs, property data is another challenge. The same hotel appears under different names. DMC partners have inconsistent contact records. Travel agent accounts are duplicated. Your operational efficiency suffers.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Travel Data</h2>

        <p>We understand both sides of travel data: guest databases that need deduplication and preference consolidation, and B2B partner data that needs validation and standardization.</p>

        <h3>Guest deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match guest records across emails, phone numbers, loyalty IDs, and name variations. We understand that booking channel fragmentation creates duplicates. We consolidate profiles while preserving booking history, preferences, and loyalty status from all sources.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per guest with complete stay history, plus merge logs showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses and phone numbers for guests and corporate contacts. Travel communications require working contact data. We flag outdated addresses and identify current information where possible.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with bounce-risk flags on stale contacts.</p>

        <h3>Corporate account cleanup</h3>
        <p>We validate contacts at corporate travel accounts, TMCs, and travel agent partners. We identify who's still at each company, update job titles, and flag accounts that need relationship rebuilding.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Current corporate contacts with job change flags for proactive re-engagement.</p>

        <h3>Property and partner standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize property names, partner records, and supplier data to consistent formats. Acquired properties get updated. Rebrands get standardized. You get clean partner data you can trust.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent property and partner records enabling accurate reporting and operations.</p>

        <h2>What Travel Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Deliver personalized experiences.</strong> When you can see a guest's full history across channels, you can recognize their preferences and treat them accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Fix loyalty program accuracy.</strong> Clean, deduplicated records mean accurate point balances and tier status. Members trust your program.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve pre-arrival communication.</strong> Emails that actually reach guests mean better upsell conversion and smoother arrivals.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain corporate relationships.</strong> Clean B2B data means you're reaching the right travel buyers and maintaining valuable contracts.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable accurate reporting.</strong> Clean property and partner data means your revenue reporting and operational metrics are trustworthy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull guest, corporate, and partner data from your PMS or CRM. We work with exports from Opera, Amadeus, Salesforce, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, stale contacts, and inconsistencies. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex guest matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate guest data immediately.</p>
