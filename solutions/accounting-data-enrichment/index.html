        <h2>The Accounting Firm Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's January. Tax season is ramping up. Your partner wants to reach out to clients who haven't scheduled their appointments yet. She pulls the list from your practice management system.</p>

        <p>First client on the list sold their business two years ago. Second one passed away last spring. Third one's email bounces because they changed companies. The CFO at your biggest corporate client? She left for a competitor six months ago, and nobody updated the record.</p>

        <p>Three hours into what should have been a simple outreach campaign, your partner is manually cross-referencing LinkedIn, calling old numbers, and wondering why the system can't just stay current.</p>

        <h3>Client contacts change faster than you can track</h3>
        <p>Research shows 30% of B2B contact data decays every year. For accounting firms, the problem compounds. You're not just tracking employees. You're tracking business owners who sell, CFOs who get promoted, controllers who change companies, and family members who take over operations. Every relationship has multiple stakeholders, and they all move.</p>

        <h3>Practice management wasn't built for relationship intelligence</h3>
        <p>Your tax software tracks returns. Your audit software tracks workpapers. Your billing system tracks invoices. None of them were designed to maintain current contact information across thousands of client relationships. According to industry surveys, roughly 74% of accounting firms lack a coherent CRM strategy. The data lives everywhere and nowhere.</p>

        <h3>Busy season makes everything worse</h3>
        <p>During tax season, nobody has time to update records. Partners are reviewing returns. Managers are managing deadlines. Staff are heads-down on workpapers. Data hygiene becomes the thing you'll definitely get to after April 15th. Then after the extension deadline. Then after year-end planning. The backlog compounds.</p>

        <h3>Advisory services need better data than compliance work</h3>
        <p>If you're pushing into advisory, CFO services, or wealth management, you need to know more than just where to send the tax return. You need to understand the client's full financial picture, their other advisors, their business relationships. That requires clean, connected data across systems.</p>

        <p>Every bounced email is an engagement letter that didn't get signed. Every wrong phone number is a billing conversation that didn't happen. Your partners deserve better than chasing ghosts through outdated records.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Accounting Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a dedicated admin just to keep your client records current. Verum takes the scattered, decaying data across your practice management system, CRM, and billing software, and makes it usable. We cross-reference multiple sources, verify contacts, and fill in gaps. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. When a CFO moves from one company to another, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For accounting firms:</strong> Stop sending engagement letters to people who left. Know when your client contact gets promoted. Follow relationships even when people change roles.</p>

        <h3>Client Record Deduplication</h3>
        <p>"Smith Manufacturing LLC." "Smith Mfg." "Smith Manufacturing." Same client, three records, fragmented engagement history. We merge them into one complete profile with full history across tax, audit, and advisory.</p>
        <p><strong>For accounting firms:</strong> See complete client history across all service lines. Know every engagement the firm has done, not just the ones tied to your particular record.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company revenue? Employee count? Industry classification? We fill in the gaps so your targeting and segmentation actually work. Know which clients are growing, which might need more services, which are at risk.</p>
        <p><strong>For accounting firms:</strong> Segment clients by size, industry, or growth trajectory. Identify which ones might need advisory services beyond compliance.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Accounting has quirks. Family businesses with complex ownership. Entities that span multiple returns. We catch what automated systems miss.</p>

        <h2>What Accounting Firms Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run tax season outreach that actually works.</strong> Send appointment reminders to current contacts at valid email addresses. Stop wasting January on bounced emails and disconnected numbers.</li>

          <li><strong>Identify advisory opportunities in your existing base.</strong> See which clients have grown, which have new CFOs, which might need services beyond compliance. Cross-sell from a position of knowledge.</li>

          <li><strong>Track client stakeholder changes.</strong> When the business owner brings in a new controller or the family business transitions to the next generation, know about it. Update relationships before the next engagement.</li>

          <li><strong>Onboard new partners without the data scavenger hunt.</strong> When lateral partners join or when you acquire another practice, give them a complete view of relevant client relationships from day one.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment clients for marketing campaigns.</strong> Know which clients are manufacturers versus retailers, which are growing versus stable, which might respond to a particular service offering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. CCH? Thomson Reuters? QuickBooks? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 30% annual decay, client data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Why Accounting Leaders Choose Verum</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>We do the work.</strong> This isn't another platform for your team to learn. Send us your data, get clean data back. Your partners stay focused on clients, not software.</li>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Clean your data before busy season, not during it.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Every project gets both.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Project-based pricing means you're not locked in.</li>

          <li><strong>We understand accounting.</strong> The difference between a tax client and an audit client. Entity structures versus operating companies. Owners versus controllers versus bookkeepers. We know the domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About Accounting Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you work with our practice management software?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with CCH Axcess, Thomson Reuters Practice CS, Wolters Kluwer, QuickBooks Online Accountant, Xero, Karbon, and most other platforms used by accounting firms. If your system can export data, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>Does this work for tax season outreach?</h3>
          <p>That's one of the most common use cases. Clean your client list before January, and your appointment scheduling emails actually reach people. No more bounces, no more wrong numbers, no more sending reminders to people who sold their businesses.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of client relationships and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh before next busy season? Pay for that refresh.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about client confidentiality?</h3>
          <p>We work with contact and company information, not financial data or tax returns. Encrypted transfers, NDAs available, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand accounting confidentiality requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with firms of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with solo practitioners and Top 100 firms. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A practice with 500 clients has the same decay issues as one with 50,000.</p>
