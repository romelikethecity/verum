        <h2>The FinTech Sales Analysis Problem</h2>

        <p>Financial services is a complex market. Community banks operate differently than regional institutions. Credit unions have different priorities than commercial banks. Neobanks move fast while traditional institutions move slow. One go-to-market strategy won't work across all segments.</p>

        <p>Most fintech companies segment by asset size. But asset size alone misses the patterns that actually predict success. A $500M credit union might be a better customer than a $5B regional bank—or vice versa, depending on your product.</p>

        <h3>Regulatory complexity varies dramatically</h3>
        <p>Smaller institutions often have less regulatory burden, making adoption faster. Larger institutions have more compliance requirements but also bigger budgets. Understanding how regulatory complexity affects your sales motion is critical.</p>

        <h3>Decision-making structures differ</h3>
        <p>Community banks might have a single decision-maker. Enterprise institutions require vendor management, security reviews, and board approval. Your data shows which buying processes you win—and which you lose.</p>

        <h3>Technology readiness is uneven</h3>
        <p>Some institutions run modern core systems and embrace innovation. Others are on legacy platforms with limited integration capabilities. Tech stack correlates strongly with sales success for most fintech solutions.</p>

        <h2>What FinTech Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Institution Type</h3>
        <p>Which financial institution types have the highest win rates? Best LTV? Fastest sales cycles? We analyze across institution type, asset size, technology stack, and geography.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Credit unions with $500M-2B in assets have 3x higher win rates than banks of similar size. Credit union buying processes better match your sales motion."</p>

        <h3>Sales Cycle Pattern Analysis</h3>
        <p>FinTech deals often stall. We identify where in the process deals get stuck and what factors predict successful progression.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Deals with IT and compliance aligned from first meeting close 2.5x faster. Single-stakeholder deals stall at security review 70% of the time."</p>

        <h3>Core System Correlation</h3>
        <p>Core banking platform often predicts success. We analyze how technology environment correlates with sales outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Institutions on Fiserv core close at 45% vs. 12% for FIS core. Integration complexity with FIS is the primary blocker."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Retention Patterns</h3>
        <p>Which customers expand to additional products? Which churn after implementation? We identify the characteristics that predict post-sale trajectory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers who achieve 50%+ user adoption in first 90 days have 95% retention. Low adoption customers churn at 40% annually."</p>

        <h2>FinTech-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Institution type.</strong> Banks, credit unions, neobanks, broker-dealers, insurance companies. Each has distinct buying patterns and success profiles.</li>

          <li><strong>Asset size bands.</strong> How does AUM correlate with deal size, sales cycle, and success? Often the relationship isn't linear.</li>

          <li><strong>Charter and regulatory environment.</strong> Federal vs. state charter, OCC vs. FDIC supervision. Regulatory context affects buying behavior.</li>

          <li><strong>Core banking platform.</strong> Fiserv, FIS, Jack Henry, modern cores. Technology environment predicts integration success.</li>

          <li><strong>Digital maturity.</strong> Innovation leaders vs. fast followers vs. traditionalists. Each segment has different adoption patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic patterns.</strong> Regional variations in competitive landscape and buying behavior.</li>
        </ul>
