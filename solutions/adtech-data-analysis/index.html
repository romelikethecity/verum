        <h2>The AdTech Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>The advertising technology market is massive but fragmented. Agencies, brands, publishers, data providers, measurement companies. Everyone touches ads. But your solution doesn't fit everyone equally.</p>

        <p>An agency trading desk evaluates technology completely differently than a brand's in-house programmatic team. A company spending $100M on programmatic has different needs than one spending $1M. And the person who bought from you last year might have moved to a competitor.</p>

        <p>Traditional segmentation misses the nuances that matter in AdTech. You need analysis that understands the difference between holding company agencies and independents, between retail media networks and traditional publishers, between brands in-housing and those doubling down on agency relationships.</p>

        <h3>Agency vs brand is fundamental</h3>
        <p>Agencies buy for efficiency across clients. Brands buy for specific campaign outcomes. Same product, completely different value propositions and sales motions. Your data reveals which buyer type you actually win with.</p>

        <h3>Programmatic vs direct splits the market</h3>
        <p>Programmatic buyers are technically sophisticated, care about integrations, and make faster decisions. Direct buyers value relationships, have longer procurement cycles, and care more about exclusivity. Your wins cluster around one or the other.</p>

        <h3>Ad spend level determines everything</h3>
        <p>A company spending $50M on digital advertising has different pain points, budget authority, and evaluation criteria than one spending $5M. Spend level isn't just about deal size. It's about product fit and buying process.</p>

        <h2>What AdTech Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not generic market research. Insights specific to your wins and losses.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Buyer Type</h3>
        <p>Which buyer types are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across agencies, brands, publishers, and other segments.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Independent agencies have 2x higher win rates than holding company agencies, but holding companies have 3x higher expansion rates. Adjust land-and-expand strategy accordingly."</p>

        <h3>Programmatic vs Direct Analysis</h3>
        <p>Does your product resonate more with programmatic buyers or direct buyers? We analyze how buying method correlates with your success metrics.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers with 70%+ programmatic spend close 40% faster and have 50% lower churn than those with balanced or direct-heavy mixes."</p>

        <h3>Ad Spend Correlation</h3>
        <p>What spending level is your sweet spot? We analyze how ad spend levels correlate with deal success, implementation complexity, and long-term value.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers spending $10M-$50M annually have the best LTV-to-CAC ratio. Below $10M, churn is too high. Above $50M, sales cycles are too long."</p>

        <h3>Account Stability Analysis</h3>
        <p>AdTech has high turnover. We analyze how buyer stability, agency-client relationships, and organizational changes affect your win rates and churn.</p>
        <p><strong>Example output:</strong> "Deals closed with buyers who've been in role 2+ years have 60% lower churn than those with new-in-role buyers. Build stability into lead scoring."</p>

        <h2>AdTech-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Buyer type.</strong> Agencies (holding company, independent, specialty), brands (in-house teams, hybrid), publishers (traditional, retail media, CTV), ad tech vendors. Each has distinct buying patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Buying method mix.</strong> Programmatic percentage, direct deal volume, preferred buying channels (DSPs, SSPs, direct publisher). Method mix signals technical sophistication and integration needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Ad spend level.</strong> Annual digital advertising budget, growth trajectory, spend concentration. Spend level correlates with pain intensity, budget authority, and decision complexity.</li>

          <li><strong>Channel focus.</strong> Display, video, CTV, audio, DOOH, retail media. Channel mix affects feature requirements and competitive dynamics.</li>

          <li><strong>Data and privacy posture.</strong> First-party data investment, cookieless preparation, clean room adoption. Privacy strategy signals sophistication and future-readiness.</li>

          <li><strong>Agency-client dynamics.</strong> For agencies: client portfolio stability, AOR status, pitch activity. For brands: in-housing trajectory, agency review status.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your AdTech market position, product category (DSP, SSP, data, measurement, etc.), and the questions driving your segmentation challenges.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible and what enrichment might strengthen the insights.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across AdTech-specific dimensions. Buyer type, buying method, spend patterns, channel focus. The analysis is built around how advertising technology gets bought.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which buyer types to prioritize, what spend levels to target, how to adjust messaging by segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, account scoring models, and sales territory design.</p>
