        <h2>The Travel &amp; Hospitality Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Travel and hospitality companies sit on rich data—booking history, loyalty program behavior, corporate account performance, seasonal patterns. But translating that data into revenue strategy is harder than it looks. Markets have shifted. Business travel patterns have changed. Old assumptions may no longer hold.</p>

        <p>Most hospitality sales teams segment by transient vs. group vs. corporate, or by rate category. But these broad segments hide the patterns that actually predict value. A mid-size corporate account with high travel density might be worth more than a larger company with sporadic needs.</p>

        <h3>Property type affects customer fit</h3>
        <p>Luxury properties attract different customers than midscale. Resorts have different booking patterns than business hotels. Understanding which property types drive revenue for which customer segments helps focus sales and marketing effort.</p>

        <h3>Chain vs. independent dynamics</h3>
        <p>Chain properties benefit from loyalty programs and central booking. Independents compete on uniqueness and direct relationships. The sales approach for corporate accounts differs significantly between models.</p>

        <h3>The post-pandemic shift</h3>
        <p>Business travel patterns have changed. Remote work affects corporate account value. Bleisure travel blurs segments. Understanding how your customer base has evolved requires fresh analysis, not assumptions from 2019.</p>

        <h3>Seasonal complexity</h3>
        <p>Travel is inherently seasonal, but seasonality varies by segment and geography. Understanding which customers provide stability and which amplify volatility helps revenue planning.</p>

        <h2>What Travel Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <h3>Customer Segmentation by Value</h3>
        <p>Which customer types have the highest LTV? Best loyalty program engagement? Strongest booking consistency? We analyze across booking channel, rate category, and customer characteristics.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Mid-size tech companies (50-200 employees) have 2.5x higher LTV than enterprise accounts despite lower per-booking revenue. Higher frequency and less price sensitivity drive the difference."</p>

        <h3>Property Type Performance Analysis</h3>
        <p>How do different property types perform with different customer segments? We identify optimal matching between inventory and target customers.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Upscale properties outperform luxury for corporate travelers on trips under 3 nights. Extended stay properties should target remote workers staying 7+ nights for highest margins."</p>

        <h3>Corporate Account Optimization</h3>
        <p>Which corporate accounts deserve more attention? Which are overserved relative to their value? We analyze account performance to optimize sales resource allocation.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Your top 20 corporate accounts by room nights represent only 35% of corporate revenue due to heavy discounting. Accounts 21-50 have better margins and expansion potential."</p>

        <h3>Booking Pattern and Channel Analysis</h3>
        <p>How do booking channels affect customer value? Which customers book direct vs. through OTAs or GDS? We analyze channel patterns and their revenue implications.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Direct bookers have 40% higher LTV than OTA-acquired customers. Shifting 10% of marketing budget from OTA commissions to direct acquisition could improve margins significantly."</p>

        <h2>Travel-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Property type and class.</strong> Luxury, upscale, midscale, economy, extended stay, resort, boutique. Each property type attracts different customer profiles.</li>

          <li><strong>Chain vs. independent.</strong> Brand-affiliated properties have different dynamics than independents. Loyalty programs, booking channels, and corporate relationships differ significantly.</li>

          <li><strong>Customer segment.</strong> Corporate, leisure, group, transient. Each segment has distinct booking patterns, price sensitivity, and loyalty characteristics.</li>

          <li><strong>Booking channel.</strong> Direct, OTA, GDS, corporate booking tools. Channel affects acquisition cost, customer value, and retention patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Seasonality and timing.</strong> Peak vs. shoulder vs. off-season. How do different customer segments behave across seasons?</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic patterns.</strong> Urban, suburban, airport, resort destinations. Location affects customer mix and competitive dynamics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your travel or hospitality business, current segmentation approach, and the questions you're trying to answer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share booking data, customer history, and account information. We identify what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions, looking for patterns that predict customer value. Travel-specific factors like property type and chain affiliation are central to the analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to prioritize, where to focus sales effort, what patterns predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help translate findings into targeting criteria, account prioritization, and revenue management adjustments.</p>
