        <h2>The Manufacturing Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell equipment, software, materials, or services to manufacturers. Your CRM contains factories, suppliers, distributors, and industrial companies. But the manufacturing sector is constantly reshaping itself.</p>

        <p>That plant you've been targeting? Closed and moved operations offshore. The procurement director you built a relationship with? Retired after 25 years. The supplier on your target list? Acquired by a competitor. Your database reflects a manufacturing landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Manufacturing data has unique challenges. Plant closures and openings, supply chain restructuring, and the ongoing reshoring wave mean your prospect data changes faster than you think.</p>

        <h3>Plant-level data goes stale quickly</h3>
        <p>Facilities open, close, and consolidate. A company might have 50 plants in your database, but only 35 are still operating. You're targeting facilities that no longer exist while missing new ones that opened. Your outreach hits dead ends.</p>

        <h3>Manufacturing contacts move and retire</h3>
        <p>Plant managers, procurement directors, and operations executives change roles regularly. The manufacturing workforce is aging, with experienced leaders retiring and new people stepping into decision-making roles. Your database doesn't reflect who actually makes purchasing decisions today.</p>

        <h3>Supply chain restructuring creates confusion</h3>
        <p>Reshoring, nearshoring, and supply chain diversification mean companies are constantly changing their manufacturing footprint. Your target might be building new facilities while closing others. Parent-subsidiary relationships shift. Your data doesn't capture the current structure.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought manufacturer databases, supplier lists, industrial contact directories. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different accuracy levels. Now you have the same company five times with conflicting plant information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for manufacturing sales. Long sales cycles and technical buying committees mean you can't afford to waste months pursuing plants that closed or contacts who retired.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Manufacturing Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy manufacturing database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company and Facility Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that manufacturing facilities still operate, flag plants that have closed or relocated, and update records where we can identify current status.</p>
        <p><strong>For manufacturing sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing closed plants. Know when facilities have relocated. Focus on active manufacturing operations that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names vary or data came from different sources. We handle parent-subsidiary relationships and multi-plant structures.</p>
        <p><strong>For manufacturing sales teams:</strong> One clean record per facility and company. Clear understanding of corporate hierarchies. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Retirements and role changes get flagged.</p>
        <p><strong>For manufacturing sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current companies. Know when contacts retire or move. Maintain relationships across changes.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, facility types, industry classifications (NAICS/SIC), and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For manufacturing sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by industry, company size, or facility type. Target automotive differently from aerospace. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Manufacturing Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on active facilities.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on plants that closed. Every account in your database represents a real manufacturing operation that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track contact changes.</strong> When decision-makers retire or move between companies, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people transition.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate corporate hierarchies.</strong> Understand parent-subsidiary relationships and multi-plant structures. Know where purchasing decisions are actually made.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by industry accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target automotive manufacturers differently from food processors, job shops differently from OEMs. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your manufacturing database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Manufacturing landscapes shift constantly. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Manufacturing Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of manufacturing data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Manufacturer databases, supplier contact lists, plant manager contacts, procurement executive data, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the manufacturing and industrial sector.</p>

          <h3>Can you track plant closures and relocations?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate company and facility data against current sources and can flag records where plants have closed, relocated, or changed ownership. This is valuable given the ongoing reshoring and supply chain restructuring.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle parent-subsidiary relationships?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can help clarify corporate hierarchies and multi-plant structures in your data. Understanding who owns what is part of what we do.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our manufacturing data?</h3>
