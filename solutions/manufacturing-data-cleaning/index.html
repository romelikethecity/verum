        <h2>The Manufacturing Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're managing relationships with hundreds of vendors, suppliers, and distributors. Your CRM and ERP systems hold critical contact and company data. But over time, that data has degraded into chaos.</p>

        <p>Manufacturing has unique data challenges. Suppliers get acquired. Plants close or relocate. Procurement contacts change frequently. And the same vendor might be in your system under their corporate name, a division name, a DBA, and a plant-specific entry. Your team wastes time figuring out which record is current instead of actually getting work done.</p>

        <h3>Vendor names are inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"Acme Manufacturing" and "Acme Mfg" and "Acme Mfg Co" and "Acme Manufacturing LLC" are the same company in your database. Maybe. Or they're different divisions. When you can't trust vendor names, spend analysis fails and supplier consolidation becomes guesswork.</p>

        <h3>Contacts are outdated</h3>
        <p>The sales rep you worked with two years ago has moved on. The plant manager retired. The procurement contact switched to a competitor. Manufacturing has high turnover in key roles, and every job change creates a stale record that wastes your team's time when they try to reach out.</p>

        <h3>Plant and location data is wrong</h3>
        <p>Suppliers open new facilities, close old ones, and consolidate operations. Your database still shows the plant that closed last year. Your logistics team plans around facilities that don't exist anymore. Accurate location data matters for supply chain planning.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates create procurement confusion</h3>
        <p>When the same supplier exists multiple times with different information, which record has the current pricing? Which one has the correct payment terms? Purchasing teams make decisions based on incomplete or conflicting data, and that costs money.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Manufacturing Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the specific challenges of manufacturing data. Supplier hierarchies that need to be captured correctly. Plant-level vs corporate-level contacts. Industry codes and certifications that matter for compliance.</p>

        <h3>Vendor deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match supplier records across names, DUNS numbers, tax IDs, and contact patterns. We understand that "Johnson Controls" and "JCI" and "Johnson Controls International" might all be the same vendor, or might be different entities. We figure out which is which.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per vendor with the most complete and current information, plus a merge log showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses and phone numbers for your supplier contacts. Manufacturing contacts often use plant-specific email domains or direct lines that need validation. We flag contacts who've left and identify current decision-makers where possible.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with job change flags on stale contacts.</p>

        <h3>Location standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize plant addresses, headquarters locations, and facility data to consistent formats. We can verify addresses against postal databases and flag locations that appear to be closed or relocated.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized, verified location data ready for logistics planning and supplier mapping.</p>

        <h3>Industry code normalization</h3>
        <p>NAICS codes, SIC codes, commodity codes. We standardize industry classifications so your segmentation and reporting actually works. No more suppliers miscategorized because someone picked the wrong code years ago.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent industry codes enabling accurate spend analysis and supplier categorization.</p>

        <h2>What Manufacturing Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Consolidate supplier spend.</strong> When you can actually see all purchases from a vendor in one place, you negotiate better. Clean data enables true spend visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve procurement efficiency.</strong> Stop wasting time figuring out which vendor record is current. Give your team clean data they can trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Execute supplier outreach.</strong> Whether it's RFQs, quality updates, or relationship building, you need to reach the right people. Clean contacts make that possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan supply chain accurately.</strong> Location data that's actually current means better logistics planning and risk assessment.</li>
          <li><strong>Support compliance requirements.</strong> Supplier audits and certifications require accurate data. Clean records make compliance easier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull vendor, supplier, and contact data from your ERP or CRM. We work with exports from SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Salesforce, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, stale contacts, inconsistent vendor names, and location issues. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex supplier hierarchies. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your procurement team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle vendor and supplier duplicates?</h3>
          <p>We match vendor records across multiple identifiers: company name variations, DUNS numbers, tax IDs, and contact information. Manufacturing companies often have the same supplier listed under different names or divisions. We consolidate these into single golden records while preserving the relationship history.</p>

          <h3>Can you standardize part numbers and product codes?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We normalize part numbers, SKUs, and product codes to consistent formats. This includes handling manufacturer part numbers vs internal part numbers, and standardizing formats across different supplier catalogs.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with ERP exports?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. We regularly clean data exported from SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, NetSuite, and other manufacturing ERPs. We understand the data structures and can work with your existing export formats.</p>

          <h3>How long does manufacturing data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most manufacturing CRM and vendor database cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Larger datasets with complex supplier hierarchies may take 3-5 business days.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle international supplier data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We clean data for suppliers across regions, handling international address formats, phone number standards, and company naming conventions. We have strong coverage for North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific suppliers.</p>
