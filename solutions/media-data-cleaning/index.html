        <h2>The Media Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell technology, services, or advertising to media and entertainment companies. Your CRM contains publishers, streaming platforms, studios, and content creators. But the media industry is in constant upheaval.</p>

        <p>That digital publisher you've been pursuing? Laid off half their staff and pivoted to video. The entertainment exec you built a relationship with? Moved to a streaming competitor. The publication on your target list? Shut down entirely. Your database reflects a media landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Media data has unique challenges. Industry restructuring, constant M&A, and workforce volatility mean your prospect data ages faster than almost any other sector.</p>

        <h3>Media consolidation reshapes the landscape</h3>
        <p>Publishers merge. Studios get acquired. Streaming platforms combine or launch new ones. The media company you've been targeting might now be part of a larger conglomerate with different decision-makers. Your target account list includes properties that no longer exist independently.</p>

        <h3>Media contacts move constantly</h3>
        <p>Layoffs, restructuring, and aggressive poaching mean media executives change jobs frequently. The decision-maker you've been nurturing might be two companies removed from where your CRM says they are. Entire teams get disbanded and reformed elsewhere.</p>

        <h3>Publications and properties launch and fold</h3>
        <p>New streaming services launch. Digital publications shut down. Content studios spin up and dissolve. Your database includes media properties that no longer exist while missing new entrants that should be targets.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought media databases, publisher lists, entertainment executive contacts. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different accuracy levels. Now you have the same company five times with conflicting information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for media sales. Tight budgets and competitive pressure mean you can't afford to waste time pursuing companies that shuttered or contacts who moved.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Media Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy media database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company and Property Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that media companies and properties still exist, flag those that have shut down or been absorbed, and update records where we can identify successor organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>For media sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing shuttered publications. Know when properties have been acquired. Focus on active media companies that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names vary or data came from different sources. We handle parent-subsidiary relationships and multi-property structures.</p>
        <p><strong>For media sales teams:</strong> One clean record per company and property. Clear understanding of ownership structures. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Layoffs and moves get flagged so you can update relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>For media sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current companies. Know when contacts get laid off or move. Maintain relationships across industry changes.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, media types (publisher, streaming, studio, creator), and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For media sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by company type and size. Target traditional publishers differently from digital-native brands. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Media Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on active properties.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on publications that shut down or studios that folded. Every account in your database represents a real media company that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track where people land.</strong> When decision-makers move between companies or get laid off, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people transition in a volatile industry.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate complex ownership.</strong> Understand conglomerate structures and which properties sit under which parent companies. Know where purchasing decisions are actually made.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by media type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target streaming platforms differently from traditional publishers, creator economy companies differently from legacy studios.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        Send us a sample of your media database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Media changes fast. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Media Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of media data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Publisher databases, media company contacts, entertainment executive lists, streaming platform data, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the media and entertainment industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you track media company acquisitions and mergers?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate company names against current data and can flag records where media companies have merged, been acquired, or shut down properties. This is especially valuable given the ongoing consolidation in media.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle the complexity of media conglomerates?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can help clarify parent-subsidiary relationships and which properties belong to which organizations. Understanding media ownership structures is part of what we do.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our media data?</h3>
          <p>Given the volatility in media, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant industry news (mergers, layoffs, shutdowns).</p>
