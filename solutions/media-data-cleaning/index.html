        <h2>The Media Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Media and entertainment is in constant flux. Conglomerates acquire and divest properties. Streaming services launch and merge. Publications shut down or pivot to digital. And the executives you're trying to reach move between companies constantly.</p>

        <p>Media has unique data challenges. The same contact might be at Disney, ABC, and ESPN all at once in your CRM. Digital publishers appear under multiple brand names. Streaming services spin off and recombine. Your database reflects years of industry chaos without proper cleanup.</p>

        <h3>Conglomerate structures are confusing</h3>
        <p>"Warner Bros. Discovery" and "HBO" and "Max" and "CNN" all need to be properly connected. Your CRM might have them as separate accounts, the same account, or some confusing mix. ABM campaigns hit the same company multiple times from different angles.</p>

        <h3>Properties change ownership constantly</h3>
        <p>That digital publication got acquired. The streaming service merged. The studio got sold. Media M&A is constant, and your database has contacts at properties that no longer exist or are now part of different companies.</p>

        <h3>Executive movement is extreme</h3>
        <p>Media executives move frequently, especially in streaming and digital. The SVP of Content you pitched is now at a competitor. The Head of Product is at a startup. Your database is full of stale contacts at wrong companies.</p>

        <h3>Brand versus company confusion</h3>
        <p>Is BuzzFeed the company or the brand? What about BuzzFeed News (which shut down)? What about Complex (which they owned)? Media brands and corporate entities get mixed up constantly.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Media Data</h2>

        <p>We understand media and entertainment structure. Conglomerate hierarchies. Network and studio relationships. The difference between properties, brands, and corporate entities.</p>

        <h3>Conglomerate hierarchy standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize media company names and map proper hierarchies. All Disney properties connect correctly to the parent. All Paramount entities are properly attributed. You can segment and report at any level.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized company names with conglomerate relationships mapped.</p>

        <h3>Property and brand normalization</h3>
        <p>We distinguish between corporate entities, network brands, and individual properties. Your data correctly reflects what level of the organization you're actually engaging with.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Clear property and brand attribution for accurate targeting.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that contacts are still at the companies you expect. Media's high turnover creates stale data fast. We flag contacts who've moved and validate email deliverability.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails with job change flags.</p>

        <h3>Defunct property cleanup</h3>
        <p>We identify and flag contacts at properties that have shut down, merged, or been significantly restructured. Stop reaching out to people at publications that no longer exist.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Records flagged for defunct properties with recommended actions.</p>

        <h2>What Media Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Run conglomerate ABM effectively.</strong> When hierarchies are mapped, you can coordinate campaigns across properties or target at the corporate level.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop chasing dead properties.</strong> Defunct property flags mean you're not pursuing contacts at publications that shut down.</li>
          <li><strong>Track industry movement.</strong> Job change tracking shows you where your contacts have landed after moves.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce email bounces.</strong> Validated emails protect your sender reputation in an industry with high turnover.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline metrics.</strong> When companies are properly attributed, your revenue reporting actually makes sense.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contacts and accounts from your CRM. We work with exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, hierarchy issues, property status, and contact validation. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, hierarchy mapping, property normalization, validation. Human review on complex conglomerate relationships. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>
