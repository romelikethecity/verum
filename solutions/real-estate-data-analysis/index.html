        <h2>The Real Estate Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>Real estate is a massive, fragmented market. Residential brokerages, commercial brokers, property management companies, institutional investors, REITs, developers. The business models vary wildly, and so do the buying processes.</p>

        <p>Most companies selling to real estate segment by obvious factors: residential vs. commercial, maybe agent count or transaction volume. But these broad categories hide the patterns that actually predict success. A 50-agent boutique brokerage might be worth 10x a 500-agent franchise.</p>

        <p>Which real estate company types have the highest win rates? Where does portfolio composition correlate with deal velocity? Which segments expand after initial purchase? Your historical data contains these answers, but extracting them requires analysis most teams don't have bandwidth for.</p>

        <h3>Agent count doesn't tell the whole story</h3>
        <p>A 100-agent luxury residential brokerage and a 100-agent commercial firm have completely different transaction values, technology needs, and decision-making processes. Treating them the same wastes resources.</p>

        <h3>Property type matters more than company size</h3>
        <p>Firms specializing in multifamily, industrial, or office properties have different pain points than single-family residential brokerages. Property type predicts technology fit better than headcount.</p>

        <h3>Portfolio size drives everything in property management</h3>
        <p>Managing 500 units is fundamentally different from managing 5,000. Portfolio size determines operational complexity, technology needs, and budget. Understanding where your sweet spot lies is critical.</p>

        <h2>What Real Estate Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not dashboards. Recommendations you can act on.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Segment</h3>
        <p>Which real estate company types are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across segments to identify where you should focus.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Mid-market property managers (1,000&#8209;5,000 units) have 4x higher LTV than large national operators. They implement faster and have higher user engagement."</p>

        <h3>Portfolio Size and Composition Analysis</h3>
        <p>Does portfolio size correlate with success? What about property type mix? We identify the sweet spots where your solution delivers the most value.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Property managers with 70%+ multifamily portfolios close 50% faster than mixed portfolios. Single property-type focus simplifies workflows and accelerates adoption."</p>

        <h3>Property Type Patterns</h3>
        <p>We analyze how property type focus correlates with buying behavior. Residential, commercial, industrial, and multifamily firms have different needs and urgency.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Commercial brokers specializing in industrial and warehouse close 2x faster than office-focused firms. Industrial demand creates technology urgency."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Churn Indicators</h3>
        <p>Which customers expand after initial purchase? Which churn? We identify the characteristics and behaviors that predict post-sale trajectory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Property managers who integrate accounting systems within 45 days have 70% higher NRR. Delayed integrations predict eventual churn."</p>

        <h2>Real Estate-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Company type.</strong> Residential brokerages, commercial brokers, property management companies, institutional investors, developers, REITs. Each has distinct buying patterns and technology needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Property types.</strong> Single-family, multifamily, office, retail, industrial, mixed-use. Property type focus often predicts technology fit and deal economics better than revenue.</li>

          <li><strong>Portfolio size.</strong> Units managed, properties under management, AUM, transaction volume. Size thresholds create distinct operational needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic footprint.</strong> Single market, regional, multi-state, national. Geographic concentration affects operational complexity and technology requirements.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> MLS systems, property management software, accounting platforms, CRM tools. Integration complexity varies dramatically by existing stack.</li>

          <li><strong>Ownership structure.</strong> Independent, franchise, corporate-owned. Decision-making authority and technology mandates differ significantly by structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your real estate market, current segmentation approach, and the questions you're trying to answer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions, looking for patterns that predict success. Property types, portfolio size, and company type are central to the analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to prioritize, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring adjustments, and resource allocation changes.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What real estate data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your real estate sales data to identify your ideal customer profile, segment accounts by property types and portfolio size, predict churn, and find patterns in win/loss data. The output is actionable recommendations for targeting brokerages, property managers, and investors.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze performance differences between residential and commercial real estate firms?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We frequently help companies understand whether their ICP skews toward residential brokerages, commercial brokers, property management companies, or institutional investors. Each segment has fundamentally different transaction volumes, technology adoption patterns, and buying processes.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle portfolio size and property type analysis?</h3>
          <p>We segment real estate firms by portfolio size (units managed, AUM, transaction volume), property types (residential, commercial, industrial, multifamily), and geographic concentration. Portfolio composition often predicts technology needs and deal economics better than company revenue alone.</p>

          <h3>What if our data is messy?</h3>
          <p>Most real estate sales data is. Portfolio sizes change constantly, property type classifications are inconsistent, and company structures are often unclear. We can clean and enrich your data before analysis.</p>
