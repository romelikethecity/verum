        <h2>The B2B Services Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're in the relationship business. Consulting, staffing, marketing, IT services—whatever your specialty, your revenue depends on knowing your clients and prospects. But your data tells a different story.</p>

        <p>The CRM has grown over years of business development. Contacts from networking events, referrals, past projects, LinkedIn connections. Nobody standardized anything. Now your team wastes time figuring out if a contact is current before they can even start a conversation.</p>

        <p>In B2B services, bad data doesn't just slow you down. It damages relationships.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates create embarrassing situations</h3>
        <p>Same client, three different records. One partner has them in their pipeline. Another thinks they're a cold prospect. A third just sent them a generic marketing email. Your firm looks disorganized. Trust erodes. The relationship you spent years building takes a hit.</p>

        <h3>Outdated contacts mean missed opportunities</h3>
        <p>That VP you worked with two years ago? They're now a CMO at a bigger company. But your CRM still shows them at the old firm. You're nurturing a dead contact while the real opportunity sits untouched. Your competitors, with better data, are already in the door.</p>

        <h3>Inconsistent data breaks your processes</h3>
        <p>One person enters "VP Marketing." Another enters "Vice President, Marketing." A third uses "VP of Mktg." Your segmentation doesn't work. Your personalization looks broken. Your reports are unreliable. Every process that depends on clean data fails.</p>

        <h3>Data silos hide the full picture</h3>
        <p>Client information scattered across CRM, email, project management, and accounting systems. Nobody has the complete view. You miss cross-sell opportunities. You don't realize that prospect is already a client in another division. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.</p>

        <p>In B2B services, your data is your institutional knowledge. When it's dirty, you lose the relationships you've worked so hard to build.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans B2B Services Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy client and prospect data and make it work for your business development. No platform to learn. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication That Preserves Relationships</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when names are spelled differently or data came from different sources. We merge intelligently, preserving relationship history, notes, and the most current information from each record.</p>
        <p><strong>For B2B services firms:</strong> One complete record per contact. No more embarrassing duplicate outreach. Clear ownership and relationship history.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation and Updates</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Outdated records get flagged so you can update them before your next outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>For B2B services firms:</strong> Confidence that your contacts are current. Reach decision-makers at their actual companies. Stop nurturing dead leads.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize job titles, company names, industries, and every other field into consistent formats. Your segmentation works. Your personalization looks professional. Your reports tell the truth.</p>
        <p><strong>For B2B services firms:</strong> Targeting that actually works. Professional communications. Reliable analytics for business development.</p>

        <h3>Cross-System Reconciliation</h3>
        <p>We can take exports from multiple systems and create one unified, clean dataset. CRM, marketing automation, accounting—we reconcile them all so you finally have a single source of truth.</p>
        <p><strong>For B2B services firms:</strong> Complete client view across all systems. No more data silos. Everyone works from the same accurate information.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About B2B Services Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets or complex requirements might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Client databases, prospect lists, CRM exports, partner contacts, referral networks, alumni lists, and any B2B data your firm uses. We focus on the data that drives relationships and revenue.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from data enrichment?</h3>
          <p>Data cleaning fixes what you have—removing duplicates, standardizing formats, validating contacts. Data enrichment adds new information like company size or recent funding. Most firms need both, and we offer both services.</p>

          <h3>What systems do you work with?</h3>
          <p>Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, Pipedrive, and any system that can export data. If you can get it into a CSV or spreadsheet, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle sensitive client data?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, secure processing, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion. We understand the confidentiality requirements of professional services.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean data from multiple systems?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We often receive exports from CRM, marketing, and project management systems simultaneously. We can clean and deduplicate across all sources, giving you one unified dataset.</p>
