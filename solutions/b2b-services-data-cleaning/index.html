        <h2>The B2B Services Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're running an agency, consultancy, or professional services firm. Your CRM holds years of client relationships, project history, and prospect data. But that data has become fragmented and unreliable.</p>

        <p>B2B services have unique data challenges. Clients engage multiple service lines. Contacts move between companies frequently. Projects get entered by different teams with inconsistent naming. And your business development team keeps adding prospects without checking for existing relationships. Your partners can't see the full client picture when they need it most.</p>

        <h3>Clients are fragmented across service lines</h3>
        <p>Your marketing team worked with Acme Corp. Your consulting team has a separate Acme record. Your analytics group created a third. Now you have three incomplete views of what should be a single strategic client relationship. Cross-sell opportunities get missed. Relationship history is scattered.</p>

        <h3>Contact information is outdated</h3>
        <p>The CMO you worked with two years ago is now at a different company. The procurement contact retired. B2B services relationships depend on people, and people move. Your outreach efforts fail when you're reaching out to contacts who left.</p>

        <h3>Prospect data is cluttered</h3>
        <p>Three years of conference leads, webinar signups, and BD outreach have accumulated. Most of those prospects have moved on, changed roles, or aren't relevant anymore. Your pipeline shows thousands of "opportunities" that will never close.</p>

        <h3>Company records are inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"Acme" and "Acme Inc" and "Acme Corporation" are all in your database. Subsidiaries are mixed with parent companies. Acquired companies still show under old names. Your account-based reporting doesn't work when the same company appears multiple ways.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See What's Wrong With Your Client Data</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans B2B Services Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the relationship-driven nature of B2B services. Client history matters. Contact relationships matter. We clean your data while preserving the context that makes it valuable.</p>

        <h3>Client deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match client records across company names, contact patterns, and engagement history. We understand that the same client might have been entered by multiple service teams. We consolidate duplicates while preserving complete project and relationship history.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per client with complete engagement history, plus merge logs showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses and phone numbers for client and prospect contacts. We flag contacts who've moved and identify current roles where possible. B2B services depend on relationships, so knowing who's still where matters.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with job change flags for relationship re-engagement.</p>

        <h3>Prospect cleanup</h3>
        <p>We identify stale prospects, validate current contact information, and flag records that should be archived or removed. Your BD team focuses on viable opportunities instead of chasing dead leads.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> A clean pipeline with current, validated prospect data.</p>

        <h3>Company standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, map parent-subsidiary relationships, and update acquired company records. Your account-level reporting finally works when each company appears consistently.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent company records enabling accurate client analytics and territory planning.</p>

        <h2>What B2B Services Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>See complete client relationships.</strong> When all engagements are consolidated, partners can see the full relationship before client meetings.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify cross-sell opportunities.</strong> Clean data reveals which clients use only one service line and could benefit from others.</li>
          <li><strong>Run effective BD campaigns.</strong> Validated prospect data means your outreach actually reaches decision-makers.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline metrics.</strong> Clean prospect data means your revenue forecasts reflect real opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain relationship continuity.</strong> Job change flags help you follow contacts to new opportunities and re-engage former champions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull client, prospect, and contact data from your CRM or PSA. We work with exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, stale contacts, and inconsistencies. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex client matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your BD team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>
