        <h2>The SaaS Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Your marketing machine is generating leads. Content downloads, webinar signups, demo requests, free trial conversions. The volume is there. But the data quality? That's where things break down.</p>

        <p>A lead comes in with a name and email. Maybe a company name, probably misspelled. Maybe a phone number, probably the main line. Now your SDR has to spend 15 minutes researching before they can even decide if this lead is worth calling. Multiply that by 50 leads a day and you've got a productivity problem.</p>

        <h3>Form fills are incomplete</h3>
        <p>Nobody wants to fill out 15 fields on a form. So you keep forms short, which means leads come in with minimal data. Name, email, company. That's not enough to prioritize, route, or personalize. Your SDRs are manually researching every lead to fill in the gaps.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack data is invisible</h3>
        <p>You sell to companies using Salesforce, or companies not using any CRM, or companies using your competitor. But you can't tell which is which from a form fill. Without tech stack data, you're flying blind on fit. Your best leads look identical to your worst ones.</p>

        <h3>Contact data is shallow</h3>
        <p>You have one contact at each company. Maybe. But B2B sales requires multi-threading. You need the VP of Sales and the CTO and the CFO. Building out the buying committee manually takes hours per account.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic data is missing</h3>
        <p>Company size, revenue, industry, funding stage. The data points that determine fit. When forms don't capture them and CRMs don't have them, your lead scoring is guesswork and your routing is broken.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We don't just append whatever data we can find. We enrich with the specific fields that SaaS sales and marketing teams need to prioritize, route, and close deals.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack</h3>
        <p>What CRM do they use? Marketing automation? Analytics platform? We identify technologies across 100+ categories so you know whether prospects are using competitors, complementary tools, or nothing at all.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data showing current tools in use, categorized and standardized for your workflows.</p>

        <h3>Contact information</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails, direct phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles. For the contact you have and for additional stakeholders you need. We build out buying committees so your reps can multi-thread from day one.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Deliverable emails with 93% accuracy guarantee, direct dials where available, and additional contacts at target accounts.</p>

        <h3>Company firmographics</h3>
        <p>Employee count, revenue range, industry, headquarters, funding status. The data points your lead scoring and routing need. We pull from multiple sources and cross-reference for accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete company profiles with standardized fields ready for your CRM and marketing automation.</p>

        <h3>Funding and growth signals</h3>
        <p>For SaaS selling to startups, funding data matters. Recent raise? Growing headcount? Hiring for your buyer persona? We identify growth signals that indicate buying intent and budget availability.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Funding history, recent news, hiring trends, and other signals of growth and buying intent.</p>

        <h2>What SaaS Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Score leads accurately.</strong> With firmographics and tech stack data, your lead scoring can actually predict fit. High-intent leads with matching tech stack go to the top. Poor-fit leads get deprioritized automatically.</li>
          <li><strong>Route to the right rep.</strong> Company size determines whether it goes to SMB or Enterprise. Industry determines territory. Tech stack determines product specialist. Enriched data makes routing work.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize at scale.</strong> Reference their tech stack in outreach. Mention their recent funding. Acknowledge their growth stage. Enriched data makes personalization possible without manual research.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With multiple contacts at each account, your reps can engage the full buying committee immediately. No more single-threaded deals dying when one champion goes dark.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus SDR time on selling.</strong> When research is done, SDRs spend time on calls and emails instead of hunting for phone numbers and company info. More touches, more pipeline.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your leads.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, or wherever. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Which fields matter most? Tech stack? Funding data? Additional contacts? We customize enrichment to your use case.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify emails, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched leads.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields appended. Your SDRs start working better leads immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What tech stack data can you provide?</h3>
          <p>We identify technologies companies are using across categories: CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot), marketing automation (Marketo, Pardot), analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel), infrastructure (AWS, Azure), and more. We detect over 10,000 technologies through web scanning, job postings, and proprietary signals.</p>

          <h3>How do you detect technology usage?</h3>
          <p>Multiple methods: website technology scanning (JavaScript libraries, tracking pixels, meta tags), job posting analysis (required skills indicate tools in use), integration marketplace presence, and proprietary data partnerships. We cross-reference sources for accuracy.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich our Salesforce leads directly?</h3>
          <p>We work with exports rather than direct CRM integrations. You export your leads, we enrich them, you import the enriched file. This approach gives you control over what gets updated and avoids permission complexity. Most teams can export, enrich, and import same-day.</p>

          <h3>What's included in firmographic enrichment?</h3>
          <p>Company size (employee count), revenue range, industry classification, headquarters location, funding status (for startups), and company description. For SaaS targets specifically, we also identify whether they're B2B vs B2C, their growth stage, and key business model indicators.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from ZoomInfo?</h3>
          <p>We enrich your existing leads rather than selling you a database. Pricing is per-project, not $15K-50K annually. And you own the data forever. We're a service that improves your data, not a subscription you're locked into.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Enrich Your SaaS Leads?</h2>

        <p><strong>Not sure what's missing?</strong> Send us a sample of 1,000 leads. We'll analyze free and show you what we can enrich.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to enrich?</strong> Most projects start same-day. You'll have enriched leads back in 24-48 hours.</p>
