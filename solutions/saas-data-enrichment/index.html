        <h2>The SaaS Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's 2pm on a Tuesday. Your SDR has a list of 50 accounts to work through. Good accounts. Companies that match your ICP perfectly on paper.</p>

        <p>First five calls: two disconnected numbers, one person who left last quarter, one company that was acquired and doesn't need your solution anymore, and one valid prospect who's actually interested. Twenty percent success rate, and that's considered pretty good.</p>

        <p>By the end of the day, your rep has made 40 dials and had 6 real conversations. The other 34 attempts? Wasted time. Bad data.</p>

        <p>This plays out across SaaS sales floors everywhere. The data decays faster than anyone can fix it manually, and your team pays the price.</p>

        <h3>Your contact data is rotting faster than you think</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.landbase.com/blog/data-decay-rate-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landbase's 2024 analysis</a>, B2B contact data decays between 22.5% and 70.3% annually. In SaaS specifically? The numbers skew toward the high end. People change jobs constantly in tech. That champion you sold to last year has probably moved twice since then.</p>

        <h3>Reps spend more time researching than selling</h3>
        <p>Salesforce's State of Sales report found that reps spend only 30% of their time actively selling. The rest goes to writing emails, entering data, researching leads, and sitting in internal meetings. And <a href="https://www.voilanorbert.com/blog/sales-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71% of sales reps</a> say they spend too much time on data entry. That's not a process problem. That's a data problem.</p>

        <h3>Bad data is actively hurting your revenue</h3>
        <p>IBM research found that incorrect data cuts into 27% of potential revenue. Not 2.7%. Twenty-seven percent. Your reps are wasting 546 hours annually pursuing bad leads. That's over 13 weeks of selling time, gone.</p>

        <h3>The performance paradox is real</h3>
        <p>Here's what's strange: 79% of sales teams increased revenue last year, but 70% of individual reps missed quota. How? Fewer reps are carrying more of the load. The top performers are crushing it while everyone else struggles with efficiency problems that clean data would solve.</p>

        <p>Every bad phone number is a wasted dial. Every outdated email is a bounced campaign. Every contact who left is a conversation that goes nowhere. Your team deserves better tools than a CRM full of decay.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves SaaS Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a dedicated RevOps person just to keep your CRM usable. Verum takes the decaying, incomplete, inconsistent data across your systems and makes it work. We cross-reference multiple sources, flag the problems, and fix them. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. When someone leaves Stripe for a Series A startup, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For SaaS teams:</strong> Stop calling people who left. Stop emailing addresses that bounce. Your SDRs spend time selling, not researching LinkedIn profiles.</p>

        <h3>Technographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing tech stack data? We append what tools your prospects are using so you can actually personalize outreach. Know who's using Salesforce vs HubSpot, who's on AWS vs Azure, who just adopted a competitor.</p>
        <p><strong>For SaaS teams:</strong> Build sequences that reference their actual stack. Prioritize prospects using technologies that integrate with yours. Skip the ones that don't fit.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Completion</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Funding status? We fill in the gaps. Know which prospects just raised a Series B and finally have budget, or which scaled from 50 to 500 employees and now need your enterprise tier.</p>
        <p><strong>For SaaS teams:</strong> Route leads to the right reps based on complete data. Stop wasting enterprise AEs on SMB accounts.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. We catch the edge cases that automated systems miss. The unusual company structures, the ambiguous job titles, the data that looks right but isn't.</p>

        <h2>What SaaS Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Increase connect rates by 40%+.</strong> When the phone numbers actually work and the people actually work there, your dials convert to conversations. Simple math.</li>

          <li><strong>Cut prospecting research time in half.</strong> Stop making SDRs spend 2 hours a day on LinkedIn confirming whether someone still works somewhere. The data is already clean. They just call.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve email deliverability overnight.</strong> Bounce rates above 2% hurt your sender reputation. Clean data means your campaigns actually land in inboxes.</li>

          <li><strong>Route leads accurately the first time.</strong> When firmographics are complete, your lead routing rules actually work. No more enterprise accounts going to SMB reps.</li>

          <li><strong>Spot expansion opportunities in your customer base.</strong> Clean data on your existing accounts reveals who's grown, who's raised funding, and who's ready for an upsell conversation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data. We'll show you where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? HubSpot? Custom CRM? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 22-70% annual decay, SaaS data needs regular maintenance. We can run monthly or quarterly refreshes. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About SaaS Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich technographic data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can append tech stack information, tools in use, and technology signals. Know which companies are using Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, AWS, or whatever matters to your targeting. This is especially useful for SaaS companies selling to other tech teams.</p>

          <h3>Do you have funding and growth data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can append funding round information, investor names, employee growth rates, and other signals. Know which companies just raised and might have new budget, or which are scaling fast and might need your enterprise tier.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new names for cold outreach, that's their strength. But if you already have thousands of contacts from years of sales activity, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have. We enrich specific data points you're missing.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year depending on seats and features. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh in six months? Pay for that refresh. No ongoing fees eating your budget while you're not actively using it.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> This is the one most people don't realize until it's too late. ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete all their data if you terminate your contract. Every contact, every enrichment field, gone. You never actually own what you paid for. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours. Forever. Cancel anytime, keep everything.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific security requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with SaaS companies from seed stage to public. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A 15-person startup has the same CRM decay issues as a 1,500-person scale-up.</p>
