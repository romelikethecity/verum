        <h2>The HR Tech Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Whether you're running an ATS with years of candidate data or selling HR software to enterprise buyers, data quality matters. But HR data decays faster than almost any other category.</p>

        <p>People change jobs constantly. Companies reorganize, merge, and rebrand. Job titles in HR vary wildly across organizations. And if you're in recruiting, you've imported candidates from every job board, career site, and referral program, creating duplicate records everywhere.</p>

        <h3>Candidates are duplicated everywhere</h3>
        <p>The same engineer applied on LinkedIn, Indeed, and your careers page. A recruiter added them manually. Now you have four records, each with different information. Your team wastes time figuring out if they've already talked to someone instead of actually recruiting.</p>

        <h3>HR buyers change roles constantly</h3>
        <p>If you're selling HR tech, you know the challenge: the CHRO you pitched last quarter is gone. The VP of Talent moved to a competitor. HR has some of the highest executive turnover of any function. Your CRM is full of contacts who've moved on.</p>

        <h3>Job titles are chaos</h3>
        <p>"Head of People" and "Chief People Officer" and "VP HR" and "SVP Human Resources" might all be the same level at different companies. Or completely different levels. Without standardization, your segmentation doesn't work and your reps don't know who they're actually talking to.</p>

        <h3>Company data is inconsistent</h3>
        <p>Startups rebrand. Companies get acquired. Divisions spin off. Your CRM shows prospects at companies that don't exist under that name anymore. Account-level reporting fails when the same company appears five different ways.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans HR Tech Data</h2>

        <p>We understand both sides of HR tech data: candidate databases that need deduplication, and B2B prospect data that needs validation and standardization.</p>

        <h3>Candidate deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match candidate records across emails, phone numbers, LinkedIn URLs, and name variations. We understand that John Smith from the Indeed import might be the same J. Smith from a referral. We consolidate duplicates while preserving application history and source data.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per candidate with complete history, plus merge logs showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>HR contact validation</h3>
        <p>For your B2B sales data, we verify that HR buyers are still at the companies you think they are. We flag contacts who've moved, validate emails, and identify current job titles. HR has high turnover, so current data matters.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with job change flags on stale contacts.</p>

        <h3>Job title standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize HR job titles to a consistent taxonomy. "Chief People Officer" and "Head of HR" and "VP Human Resources" get mapped to comparable levels so your segmentation actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized titles enabling accurate targeting by seniority and function.</p>

        <h3>Company name normalization</h3>
        <p>We standardize company names so your ABM campaigns and account reporting work. Acquired companies get flagged. Rebrands get updated. You get clean company data you can trust.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent company names enabling accurate account-level analytics.</p>

        <h2>What HR Tech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Improve candidate experience.</strong> Stop emailing the same person multiple times about the same role. Clean data means coordinated outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Run targeted sales campaigns.</strong> When HR buyers are properly segmented by title and company size, your campaigns reach the right people with relevant messaging.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline metrics.</strong> Clean company data means your revenue reporting by segment and company size actually means something.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce wasted outreach.</strong> Stop reaching out to people who've left. Clean, validated data means your team spends time on real opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable account-based recruiting.</strong> For recruiting teams, clean company data enables sophisticated account-based talent strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull candidates from your ATS or prospects from your CRM. We work with exports from Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, Salesforce, HubSpot, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, stale contacts, email validity, and title inconsistencies. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle candidate duplicates from multiple sources?</h3>
          <p>We match candidate records across email addresses, phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles, and name variations. Recruiting teams often have the same person from job boards, referrals, and direct applications. We consolidate these into single records while preserving source attribution.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean both candidate and company data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. HR tech companies typically have two data challenges: candidate/talent data and B2B prospect data for selling their platform. We clean both. For candidates, we focus on deduplication and contact validation. For B2B prospects, we standardize company names and validate HR buyer contacts.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with ATS exports?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. We regularly clean data exported from Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, iCIMS, Bullhorn, and other ATS platforms. We understand the data structures and can work with your existing export formats.</p>

          <h3>How long does HR tech data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most HR tech CRM cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Large candidate databases or complex deduplication may take 3-5 business days. We'll give you a timeline after reviewing your export.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle international candidate data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We clean candidate and company data across regions, handling international name formats, phone standards, and company naming conventions. We have strong coverage for North America, Europe, and major global markets.</p>
