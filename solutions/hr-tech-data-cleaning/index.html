        <h2>The HR Tech Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell recruiting software, HRIS, benefits platforms, or people analytics tools. Your CRM is full of HR leaders across thousands of companies. But HR leadership changes constantly.</p>

        <p>That VP of People you've been nurturing? Left to join a startup. The CHRO who showed interest? Retired last quarter. The Head of Talent Acquisition on your target list? Position was eliminated in restructuring. Your database reflects an HR landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>HR tech sales data has unique challenges. High turnover, constantly evolving titles, and the way companies restructure people functions mean your prospect data goes stale fast.</p>

        <h3>HR leaders change jobs frequently</h3>
        <p>CHRO tenure averages around 3.5 years—shorter than most C-suite roles. VPs of People, Heads of HR, and talent leaders move even more often. That contact list from last year? A significant portion has already moved on.</p>

        <h3>HR titles are inconsistent</h3>
        <p>"Chief People Officer," "VP People," "CHRO," "Head of Human Resources," "Chief Human Resources Officer"—all potentially the same role at the same level. Your segmentation breaks when the same buyer persona appears under a dozen different titles.</p>

        <h3>Company restructuring affects HR first</h3>
        <p>When companies grow, shrink, or reorganize, HR structure changes. Roles get consolidated. Departments get split. The "VP of HR" becomes "VP of People & Culture" or gets absorbed into a "Chief Administrative Officer" role. Your data doesn't keep up.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought HR leader databases, CHRO lists, people ops contact data. Each list has different title conventions, different ages, different accuracy levels. Now you have the same person five times with different titles and companies.</p>

        <p>Clean data is your competitive advantage in HR tech. While others send emails to people who left months ago, you could be building relationships with actual decision-makers.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See How Clean Data Transforms HR Tech Sales</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans HR Tech Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy HR leader database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation and Job Change Detection</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. When HR leaders move, we flag the outdated records so you can update your outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>For HR tech sales teams:</strong> Stop nurturing dead contacts. Know when CHROs move before your competitors do. Reach decision-makers at their current companies.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when titles differ or data came from different lists. We merge intelligently, keeping the most recent and complete information from each record.</p>
        <p><strong>For HR tech sales teams:</strong> One clean record per contact. No more embarrassing duplicate outreach. Clear ownership in your CRM.</p>

        <h3>Title Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize HR titles so "Chief People Officer," "VP People," and "CHRO" are consistently categorized. Your segmentation by seniority and function actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>For HR tech sales teams:</strong> Target by role accurately. Build reliable lists of C-level HR vs. VP-level vs. director-level. Messaging that matches the audience.</p>

        <h3>Email Validation</h3>
        <p>We check every email against multiple validation sources. Invalid addresses, role-based emails, and known bounces get flagged before they hurt your sender reputation.</p>
        <p><strong>For HR tech sales teams:</strong> Higher deliverability rates. Fewer bounces. Outbound that actually reaches inboxes.</p>

        <h2>What HR Tech Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach actual decision-makers.</strong> When contacts are validated and job changes detected, your outreach hits real HR leaders at real companies. Not former employees, not bounced emails.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by seniority accurately.</strong> Standardized titles let you target CHROs differently from VPs, directors differently from managers. Messages resonate because they match the audience level.</li>

          <li><strong>Track where HR leaders go.</strong> When decision-makers move companies, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people change employers.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> When duplicates are removed and contacts validated, your pipeline numbers reflect reality. Forecasting works when data is clean.</li>

          <li><strong>Protect your sender reputation.</strong> Every bounced email hurts deliverability. Clean email lists mean higher inbox placement rates for all your outbound.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of what cleaning can realistically accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample export. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        HR leaders move frequently. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About HR Tech Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of HR tech data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>HR leader databases, CHRO contact lists, people operations contacts, HR tech buyer data, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach human resources decision-makers.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle the variety of HR titles?</h3>
          <p>We standardize HR titles across variations. VP People, Chief People Officer, CHRO, Head of HR all get normalized into consistent categories so your segmentation and targeting work correctly.</p>

          <h3>What CRMs and tools do you work with?</h3>
          <p>Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Apollo, and any system that can export data. If you can get it into a CSV or spreadsheet, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>Can you help identify when contacts change jobs?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We cross-reference contacts against current employment data and flag records where the person appears to have moved. This is especially valuable in HR where turnover is high.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our data?</h3>
          <p>Given the turnover rate in HR leadership, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after purchasing new lists.</p>
