        <h2>The Legal Data Gap Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to law firms. You know your target firms and practice areas. But your CRM has firm names and maybe a general phone number. That's not enough to run an effective sales motion.</p>

        <p>Law firm data is notoriously hard to get. Firms protect their attorneys' contact information. Decision-makers for technology purchases often aren't listed on websites. Practice area specializations aren't standardized. Your SDRs are spending hours researching each firm just to find the right person to contact.</p>

        <h3>Contact data is protected</h3>
        <p>Law firm websites list attorney names but rarely direct contact information. Main office numbers go to receptionists. Generic emails go to marketing departments. Without verified direct contact data, you're not reaching decision-makers.</p>

        <h3>Decision-makers aren't always attorneys</h3>
        <p>If you're selling technology, the buyers might be the CIO, legal ops director, or innovation partner. These roles aren't always easy to find, and they're rarely the people featured on firm websites.</p>

        <h3>Practice area data is incomplete</h3>
        <p>You want to target M&A partners or patent prosecutors. But firm websites often list attorneys under broad categories like "Litigation" without the granularity you need for targeting. You need verified practice area data to segment effectively.</p>

        <h3>Firm-level data is scattered</h3>
        <p>Headcount, revenue, profits per partner, office locations, tech stack. The firmographic data that determines fit is spread across rankings, press releases, and proprietary databases. Nobody has time to compile it manually.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data legal tech and legal services companies need to identify, qualify, and engage law firms.</p>

        <h3>Attorney contact data</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for attorneys. Partner, associate, counsel, of counsel designations. Practice group assignments. Bar admissions and status. The data your reps need to reach the right attorneys.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for target attorneys.</p>

        <h3>Legal ops and tech buyer contacts</h3>
        <p>For legal tech sales, we identify and provide contacts for non-attorney decision-makers: legal operations directors, CIOs, CTOs, COOs, innovation partners, procurement leads. These are often the actual buyers for technology at law firms.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Verified contacts for legal tech decision-makers beyond the attorney roster.</p>

        <h3>Practice area enrichment</h3>
        <p>Detailed practice area assignments beyond what firm websites show. Patent prosecution vs patent litigation. M&A vs private equity. Employment defense vs employment plaintiff. The granularity you need for targeted campaigns.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized, detailed practice area data for segmentation and personalization.</p>

        <h3>Firm firmographics</h3>
        <p>Attorney headcount, office count, geographic footprint, revenue and PPP (for ranked firms), practice area breakdown, growth trajectory. The firm-level data that determines fit and deal size.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firm profiles with the metrics that matter for your targeting.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack</h3>
        <p>What practice management system do they use? What document management? eDiscovery platform? We identify legal-specific technology so you can qualify fit and personalize outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data showing current legal technology in use.</p>

        <h2>What Legal Tech Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Target by practice area.</strong> Enriched practice data means your IP campaign hits IP attorneys and your litigation campaign hits litigators. No more generic outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach actual buyers.</strong> With legal ops and innovation contacts identified, you're reaching the people who actually make technology decisions, not just attorneys.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by firm size.</strong> Firmographic data lets you instantly qualify whether a firm is enterprise or SMB, growing or shrinking, Am Law or regional.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize with tech stack.</strong> "I see you're using NetDocuments" opens more conversations than generic pitches. Tech stack data enables relevant outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With multiple contacts at each firm, your reps can engage partners and legal ops and IT simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Firm names, target practice areas, whatever you have. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Attorney contacts? Legal ops? Firmographics? Tech stack? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What attorney data can you enrich?</h3>
          <p>We enrich attorney records with verified work emails, direct phone numbers, bar numbers and status, practice areas, law school, graduation year, and LinkedIn profiles. For attorney contacts, we also identify their level (partner, associate, counsel) and practice group.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich with law firm firmographic data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We provide firm-level data including attorney headcount, office locations, practice area breakdown, revenue (for ranked firms), profits per partner, and technology stack. For Am Law firms, we have extensive ranking and financial data.</p>

          <h3>How do you identify legal tech decision-makers?</h3>
          <p>For legal tech sales, attorneys aren't always the buyers. We identify and provide contacts for legal operations directors, CIOs, CTOs, COOs, and innovation partners. These roles are often the actual decision-makers for technology purchases at law firms.</p>

          <h3>What's your coverage for small firms and solo practitioners?</h3>
          <p>Coverage varies by firm size. For Am Law 200 and mid-size firms, we typically achieve 85%+ enrichment rates. For small firms and solo practitioners, rates are 60-75% depending on the attorneys' online presence. We'll give you expected match rates before you commit.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from legal directories?</h3>
          <p>Directories like Martindale or Chambers list attorneys but often lack direct contact data and firm-level insights. We provide verified emails and phone numbers, not just listings. And we enrich your existing data rather than starting you from scratch.</p>
