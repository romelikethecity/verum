        <h2>The Law Firm Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's Friday afternoon. A partner is preparing for a pitch meeting next week. Big potential client in the pharmaceutical industry. She knows the firm has done work in this space before, knows there are relationships to leverage.</p>

        <p>She opens the CRM. Three different records for the same company, each with different contacts. One shows a GC who retired two years ago. Another has an email that bounces. The third has a phone number that goes to a fax machine. She spends an hour on LinkedIn trying to figure out who actually works there now.</p>

        <p>This happens constantly at law firms. The CRM was supposed to make business development easier. Instead, it's become a graveyard of outdated information that nobody trusts.</p>

        <h3>Your CRM data is mostly incomplete</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/interaction/blog/data-quality-the-unsung-hero-to-your-law-firms-crm-success.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry research</a>, 90% of client data in law firm CRMs is incomplete. Missing phone numbers. Outdated titles. Email addresses that haven't worked in years. The data exists in fragments across the system, but nobody has stitched it together.</p>

        <h3>Attorneys have given up on the system</h3>
        <p>Only 29% of attorneys use the CRM consistently. The rest have stopped trusting it. When the data is wrong more often than it's right, why bother checking? They fall back on personal Rolodexes, Outlook contacts, and memory. All that institutional knowledge stays locked in individual heads instead of being shared across the firm.</p>

        <h3>Contact decay is relentless</h3>
        <p>Research shows that <a href="https://natlawreview.com/article/how-improve-data-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% of contact data degrades every year</a>. General counsels move companies. In-house lawyers get promoted. Companies merge, rebrand, relocate. Your CRM doesn't update itself. Every month that passes, your data gets a little more stale.</p>

        <h3>The cost of fixing it reactively is enormous</h3>
        <p>Studies show that fixing bad data costs 10 times more than preventing it in the first place. Every hour a partner spends researching contacts is an hour not spent on billable work or actual business development. Gartner puts the average cost of bad data at $12.9 million annually across industries. For law firms, that shows up in missed opportunities, embarrassing outreach, and duplicated effort.</p>

        <p>The irony is that most firms know their data is bad. The 2024 CRM Success Survey found firms rated their data quality at just 6 out of 10. But knowing it's bad and fixing it are two different things. Nobody has time to clean up decades of accumulated records.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Law Firm Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a full-time data steward just to keep your CRM usable. Verum takes the fragmented, outdated, duplicate-riddled data across your systems and makes it work. We cross-reference multiple sources, merge records, and fill in gaps. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. When a general counsel moves from one company to another, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For law firms:</strong> Stop sending pitch materials to people who left. Know when your contact at a client gets promoted. Maintain relationships even when people change roles.</p>

        <h3>Record Deduplication</h3>
        <p>"Acme Corp." "Acme Corporation." "ACME, Inc." Same client, three records. We merge them into one complete profile with full history. No more confusion about which record is current.</p>
        <p><strong>For law firms:</strong> See the complete picture of client relationships across all practice areas. Know every matter the firm has handled for a client, not just the ones tied to your particular record.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Industry classification? We fill in the gaps so your targeting actually works. Know which clients are growing, which industries are consolidating, which companies just made acquisitions.</p>
        <p><strong>For law firms:</strong> Segment your pitch lists by company size, industry, or growth stage. Stop treating a Fortune 500 the same as a startup.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. We catch the edge cases that automated systems miss. The unusual corporate structures, the holding companies, the contacts with multiple roles at different entities.</p>

        <h2>What Law Firms Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Get attorneys to actually use the CRM.</strong> When the data is trustworthy, people check it. When they check it, they update it. Clean data creates a virtuous cycle of adoption.</li>

          <li><strong>Identify cross-sell opportunities across practice areas.</strong> See complete client relationships across the entire firm. Know when corporate's client might need litigation support, or when M&A's deal target could use regulatory counsel.</li>

          <li><strong>Prepare for pitches in minutes, not hours.</strong> Pull complete client histories and contact information without the research scavenger hunt. Walk into meetings knowing the full relationship.</li>

          <li><strong>Track alumni and referral sources.</strong> Former clients move to new companies. In-house lawyers become potential clients. Clean data lets you follow these relationships instead of losing them.</li>

          <li><strong>Onboard lateral hires without the data migration nightmare.</strong> When new partners join, give them a complete view of relevant relationships from day one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. InterAction? Salesforce? HubSpot? Practice management integration? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 30% annual decay, legal data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Legal Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle confidentiality?</h3>
          <p>We work with contact data and company information, not case files or privileged materials. We never see matter details or client communications. Encrypted transfers, NDAs available, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand legal industry confidentiality requirements.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with InterAction?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We've worked with InterAction, ContactEase, Salesforce, HubSpot, and most other CRM platforms used by law firms. If your system can export data, we can clean it. If you want cleaned data pushed back into your CRM, we can work with your IT team on that too.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new names for business development outreach, that's their strength. But if you already have decades of client contacts and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have. We enrich specific data points you're missing.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year depending on seats and features. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh in six months? Pay for that refresh. No ongoing fees eating your budget while you're not actively using it.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> This is the one most people don't realize until it's too late. ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete all their data if you terminate your contract. Every contact, every enrichment field, gone. You never actually own what you paid for. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours. Forever. Cancel anytime, keep everything.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific security requirements. We work with AmLaw 100 firms that have stringent security protocols.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with firms of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with firms from 10 attorneys to 10,000. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A boutique with 1,000 contacts has the same decay issues as a global firm with 100,000.</p>
