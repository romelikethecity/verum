        <h2>The Manufacturing Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's the first week of Q4. Your regional sales manager is building a push list for year-end. Big accounts that might close before December. Prospects who've been evaluating for months. Distributors who might stock up before the new year.</p>

        <p>She pulls the CRM report. 200 accounts in her territory that touched the pipeline this year. She starts calling. First twenty: three buyers who retired, four who moved to different companies, two plants that closed, five voicemails to numbers that seem wrong, and six actual conversations. Two of those six say they already bought from a competitor while waiting for a quote that never came.</p>

        <p>The 84-day sales cycle doesn't leave room for chasing bad data. Every wasted call is a real opportunity cost.</p>

        <h3>CRM adoption is high, but so is failure</h3>
        <p>Manufacturing sits at <a href="https://www.b2breviews.com/crm-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86% CRM adoption</a>, among the highest of any industry. But adoption isn't the same as success. Research puts CRM project failure rates between 20% and 70%. The top cause? Poor data quality. All that software doesn't help when the underlying records are wrong.</p>

        <h3>Contact decay is relentless</h3>
        <p>Dun & Bradstreet research shows contact data decays at roughly 25% annually. One quarter of your database becomes obsolete every single year. In manufacturing, where relationships span decades and sales cycles run for months, that decay compounds. The engineer you quoted last year? The purchasing manager who loved your demo? They might not even work there anymore.</p>

        <h3>Long sales cycles make bad data expensive</h3>
        <p>The average B2B sales cycle runs 84 days. And 75% of buyers are taking longer to decide than they used to, with 10 or more people typically involved in the final purchase decision. When your cycle is that long and that complex, you can't afford to waste weeks nurturing a contact who left. Every bad data point extends the cycle or kills the deal entirely.</p>

        <h3>Manual data entry remains a major obstacle</h3>
        <p>23% of CRM users cite manual data entry as their primary frustration. In manufacturing, where field reps collect business cards at trade shows and inside sales teams handle inbound leads, the data entry burden is enormous. And 88% of sales professionals say accurate customer data is a top priority for effective CRM use. The two facts don't reconcile easily.</p>

        <p>Every wrong phone number is a wasted call in a quarter that's running out of days. Every outdated email is a quote that never arrives. Your sales team deserves better than spending half their time verifying information.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Manufacturing Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a dedicated data analyst just to keep your CRM usable. Verum takes the decaying, incomplete, duplicate-riddled data across your systems and makes it work. We cross-reference multiple sources, verify contacts, and fill in gaps. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating phone numbers, and catching bounced emails before they happen. When a buyer moves to a different plant or a purchasing manager retires, we know.</p>
        <p><strong>For manufacturing teams:</strong> Stop calling people who left. Stop emailing addresses that bounce. Your reps spend time selling, not researching LinkedIn.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Plant locations? Number of employees? We fill in the gaps so your segmentation and territory planning actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For manufacturing teams:</strong> Know which prospects are large enough to need your equipment. Understand plant footprints for cross-sell opportunities. Prioritize by actual potential.</p>

        <h3>Distributor and Channel Partner Data</h3>
        <p>Your channel is only as good as your data on it. We can clean and enrich your distributor contacts, rep firm data, and partner network records.</p>
        <p><strong>For manufacturing teams:</strong> Know which contacts at your distributors are current. Track when reps move between firms. Keep your channel relationships intact.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Manufacturing data has quirks. Multi-plant companies with different contacts per location. Holding companies that own multiple brands. We catch what automated systems miss.</p>

        <h2>What Manufacturing Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Shorten effective sales cycles.</strong> When you're not wasting weeks on dead contacts, your real sales cycle compresses. More time with actual buyers, less time chasing ghosts.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve trade show ROI.</strong> That stack of business cards from IMTS? We can verify which ones are still current before you waste time on follow-up that goes nowhere.</li>

          <li><strong>Enable territory planning that actually works.</strong> When firmographics are complete and contacts are verified, territory assignments reflect reality instead of guesswork.</li>

          <li><strong>Maintain distributor relationships.</strong> Know when your contacts at key distributors change. Don't find out six months later that your champion left and nobody told you.</li>

          <li><strong>Clean up decades of accumulated data.</strong> Most manufacturing CRMs have records going back 20+ years. We help you separate active prospects from historical noise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? Microsoft Dynamics? Industry-specific CRM? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 25% annual decay, manufacturing data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Manufacturing Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich distributor and channel partner data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can verify and enrich contact data for distributors, manufacturers' reps, and channel partners. Know which contacts are current, which have moved on, and where the gaps are in your partner network.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with our ERP/CRM integration?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Epicor, NetSuite, and most other systems used in manufacturing. If your platform can export data, we can clean it. If you want cleaned data pushed back in, we can work with your IT team on that.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have decades of customer and prospect data, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh before your trade show season? Pay for that refresh.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific security requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with small job shops and Fortune 500 manufacturers. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A CRM with 5,000 contacts has the same decay issues as one with 500,000.</p>
