        <h2>The Manufacturing Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to manufacturers. OEMs, suppliers, job shops, industrial companies. Your CRM has company names and maybe a main office number. That's not enough to run an effective sales motion.</p>

        <p>Manufacturing data is notoriously hard to get. Companies don't put their plant managers' direct lines online. Decision-makers vary by facility. Firmographic data like production capacity and certifications lives in scattered databases. Your SDRs spend hours researching each account before they can start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>Contacts are hidden</h3>
        <p>Manufacturing companies protect their operations teams. You might find a corporate directory, but good luck reaching the plant manager who actually makes equipment decisions. General numbers go to reception. Generic emails go nowhere. Without direct contact data, you're not getting through.</p>

        <h3>Plant vs corporate confusion</h3>
        <p>A manufacturer with 12 plants has 12 potential opportunities. But your CRM just shows the corporate HQ. You don't know which facilities are relevant, who runs each plant, or where decisions actually get made.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic data is scattered</h3>
        <p>Employee count, revenue, production capabilities, certifications, equipment types. The data that determines if a manufacturer is a fit for your product. This information exists but it's spread across industry databases, trade publications, and proprietary sources.</p>

        <h3>No visibility into technology</h3>
        <p>What ERP do they run? What PLM system? What automation equipment? If you're selling to manufacturing IT or operations, knowing their current stack is essential for qualification and personalization. But manufacturers don't advertise this.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that manufacturing sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage industrial companies.</p>

        <h3>Operations contact data</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for manufacturing decision-makers. Plant managers, operations directors, VP of manufacturing, procurement managers, quality directors, engineering leads. The people your reps need to reach, with contact info that works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for target contacts.</p>

        <h3>Plant-level intelligence</h3>
        <p>We go beyond corporate data to provide plant-specific information. Facility addresses, employee counts, production capabilities, and key contacts at each location. This lets you target specific plants rather than just corporate entities.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Plant-level data enabling location-specific targeting and account planning.</p>

        <h3>Manufacturing firmographics</h3>
        <p>Revenue, employee count, production volume, facility square footage, number of plants. The metrics that determine if a manufacturer is in your target range and how to position your solution.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firmographic profiles for manufacturing targets.</p>

        <h3>Certifications and capabilities</h3>
        <p>ISO certifications, AS9100, IATF 16949, NADCAP, industry-specific compliance. These certifications signal what industries a manufacturer serves and often indicate technology adoption and process maturity.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Certification data enabling qualification and relevant positioning.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack</h3>
        <p>ERP systems, PLM/PDM, MES, automation platforms, CAD/CAM software. We identify what technologies manufacturers are running so you can qualify fit and personalize outreach based on their current environment.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data showing current systems across key manufacturing categories.</p>

        <h2>What Manufacturing Sales Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Target by plant, not just company.</strong> Enriched plant data means you can run campaigns specific to facility types, locations, or capabilities. No more generic corporate outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach actual decision-makers.</strong> With plant managers and operations contacts identified, you're reaching the people who influence equipment and technology decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by certifications.</strong> Certification data lets you instantly identify manufacturers who serve specific industries like aerospace, automotive, or medical devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize with tech stack.</strong> "I see you're running SAP" opens more conversations than generic pitches. Tech stack data enables relevant outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With contacts across plants and functions, your reps can engage operations, procurement, and engineering simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Company names, target industries, whatever accounts you're working. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Plant contacts? Full org mapping? Certifications? Tech stack? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>
