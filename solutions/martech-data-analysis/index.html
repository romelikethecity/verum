        <h2>The MarTech Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>Everyone's a potential buyer in MarTech. Every company has marketing. Every marketing team uses tools. Your TAM spreadsheet looks incredible. But most of those logos will never buy from you.</p>

        <p>Some companies are locked into platform ecosystems that make your solution redundant. Others have the opposite problem: so many disconnected tools that adding another creates more chaos than value. And then there's the CMO who just started and wants to rip out everything the last person bought.</p>

        <p>The signals that predict MarTech buying are specific and nuanced. Company size doesn't tell you if they have attribution challenges. Industry doesn't reveal their stack composition. You need analysis that understands how marketing teams actually buy technology.</p>

        <h3>Stack composition drives everything</h3>
        <p>A HubSpot-centric company buys differently than a Salesforce Marketing Cloud shop. Companies building on Segment have different integration needs than those with homegrown CDP attempts. Your winning deals cluster around specific stack patterns. Your data reveals which ones.</p>

        <h3>Attribution maturity signals readiness</h3>
        <p>Companies still debating last-click vs first-click aren't ready for sophisticated solutions. Companies with mature multi-touch attribution understand measurement, have budget authority, and speak the language. Attribution maturity is a proxy for marketing sophistication.</p>

        <h3>CMO tenure creates windows</h3>
        <p>New CMOs have 18 months to show results. They're rebuilding stacks, questioning vendor choices, and open to new approaches. CMOs in year three are in maintenance mode. Understanding where your deals close relative to CMO tenure reveals timing patterns.</p>

        <h2>What MarTech Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not another dashboard to ignore. Recommendations that change how you target and sell.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Stack Composition</h3>
        <p>Which marketing technology environments are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, and churn across different stack architectures to identify where you win.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Companies with Salesforce + Marketo + custom attribution have 3x higher win rates than HubSpot-only environments. They also have 2x larger initial contracts."</p>

        <h3>Attribution Maturity Correlation</h3>
        <p>Does marketing measurement sophistication predict your success? We segment by attribution maturity and analyze how it correlates with buying behavior.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Companies with multi-touch attribution close 40% faster and have 60% higher expansion rates. Target companies advertising MTA job postings."</p>

        <h3>Integration Complexity Analysis</h3>
        <p>Are you winning in simple environments or complex ones? We analyze stack complexity and integration patterns to understand where your solution fits best.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Customers with 50+ MarTech tools churn at 2x the rate of those with 20-50. Sweet spot is mid-complexity stacks with clear integration gaps."</p>

        <h3>Buyer Persona Effectiveness</h3>
        <p>CMO, VP Marketing, Marketing Ops, RevOps. Which buyers drive closed deals? We identify the personas and organizational structures that correlate with wins.</p>
        <p><strong>Example output:</strong> "Deals with Marketing Ops involvement close at 2x the rate of CMO-only deals. Marketing Ops champions correlate with faster implementation and lower churn."</p>

        <h2>MarTech-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Marketing stack composition.</strong> Core platforms (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce MC, etc.), CDPs, analytics tools, attribution systems. Stack architecture predicts integration needs and buying patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Attribution maturity.</strong> Last-click, first-click, linear, time-decay, custom MTA, MMM. Measurement sophistication signals marketing team maturity and budget authority.</li>

          <li><strong>Stack complexity.</strong> Number of tools, integration patterns, data flow architecture. Complexity level correlates with both opportunity and implementation risk.</li>

          <li><strong>Marketing team structure.</strong> Dedicated Marketing Ops, RevOps function, in-house vs agency model. Organizational structure affects buying process and success metrics.</li>

          <li><strong>CMO tenure and stability.</strong> New CMOs drive change. Long-tenured CMOs maintain status quo. Leadership transitions create buying windows.</li>

          <li><strong>Budget and spend patterns.</strong> Marketing budget as percentage of revenue, historical tech spend, vendor consolidation initiatives. Financial patterns reveal buying capacity and priorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your MarTech market position, competitive landscape, and the questions you need answered about your ideal customer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible and what enrichment might help.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across MarTech-specific dimensions. Stack composition patterns, attribution maturity signals, integration complexity. The analysis is built around how marketing teams buy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which stack environments to target, what maturity signals to look for, how to adjust messaging by segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring models, and ABM campaign parameters.</p>
