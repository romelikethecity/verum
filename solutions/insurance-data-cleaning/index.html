        <h2>The Insurance Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to insurance agents, brokers, and agencies. Your CRM has tens of thousands of producer records. But insurance is a highly regulated industry where data accuracy isn't just about efficiency. It's about compliance.</p>

        <p>Agents change agencies constantly, chasing better commission structures or following books of business. Licenses expire or get suspended. And every carrier data feed, trade show, and purchased list adds duplicates without any validation.</p>

        <h3>Agents change agencies constantly</h3>
        <p>The agent at State Farm is now independent. The independent broker just joined a cluster. The entire agency got acquired by a larger firm. Every change means wrong emails, wrong phone numbers, and wrong agency affiliations in your database.</p>

        <h3>License data gets stale fast</h3>
        <p>Producer licenses expire. Some agents let them lapse. Others get suspended for compliance issues. If you're a carrier or MGA, working with unlicensed producers is a regulatory problem. Your CRM doesn't automatically flag when licenses are no longer valid.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates pile up from everywhere</h3>
        <p>Carrier appointment feeds, conference attendee lists, purchased producer databases, referral partner uploads. Every source creates records without checking if the agent already exists. Now you have four records for the same top producer with conflicting information.</p>

        <h3>Lines of authority are a mess</h3>
        <p>"P&C" and "Property and Casualty" and "Property/Casualty" are all the same line. Your segmentation breaks when you can't reliably target agents by the lines they're licensed to sell.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Insurance Data</h2>

        <p>We understand insurance data challenges. NPN validation, lines of authority, agency hierarchies, and the regulatory requirements that make data accuracy non-negotiable.</p>

        <h3>License validation</h3>
        <p>We verify producer licenses against state insurance department databases. Is the license active? What lines of authority? Does the NPN match the agent name? We flag expired, suspended, or mismatched licenses before they become compliance problems.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Validated license status with NPN verification and lines of authority for every producer.</p>

        <h3>Agency change detection</h3>
        <p>We identify when agents have switched agencies. The record shows Farmers but they're now at an independent agency? We flag it and provide current affiliation data. You stop marketing to people at companies they left.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Flagged records for agency changes with current affiliation where available.</p>

        <h3>NPN-based deduplication</h3>
        <p>We dedupe using NPN as the primary key, plus fuzzy matching on names and email patterns. John Smith at ABC Insurance and J. Smith at ABC Agency might be the same producer. We figure that out and create one clean record.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per producer with the most complete, most current information.</p>

        <h3>Lines of authority standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize lines of authority to consistent categories. "P&C," "Property and Casualty," and "Property/Casualty" become one standardized value. Your segmentation by line of business actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Standardized lines of authority ready for targeting and compliance reporting.</p>

        <h2>What Insurance Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Stay compliant.</strong> License validation ensures you're only working with actively licensed producers. No more compliance surprises from expired or suspended licenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Target by line of business.</strong> Standardized lines of authority mean your P&C campaign reaches P&C agents and your life campaign reaches life agents.</li>
          <li><strong>Track agency movement.</strong> When agents change agencies, clean data helps you reconnect and update your relationship records.</li>
          <li><strong>Run accurate reporting.</strong> When duplicates are gone and agencies are standardized, your producer count and distribution metrics are reliable.</li>
          <li><strong>Merge carrier feeds cleanly.</strong> Multiple carrier appointment files coming in? Clean and dedupe them before they pollute your master database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull producer records from your agency management system, CRM, or carrier database. We work with standard exports.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, license status, agency inconsistencies, and email validity. You get a report even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, license validation, standardization. Human review on edge cases. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your compliance team can trust the data.</p>
