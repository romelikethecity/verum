        <h2>The Insurance Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell technology, services, or capacity to insurance companies. Your CRM contains carriers, agencies, MGAs, and brokers. But the insurance industry is consolidating faster than ever.</p>

        <p>That independent agency you've been nurturing? Acquired by a PE-backed aggregator last month. The agency principal you built a relationship with? Cashed out and retired. The MGA on your target list? Merged with a competitor. Your database reflects an insurance distribution landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Insurance data has unique challenges. Record agency M&A activity, carrier restructuring, and the complexity of distribution relationships mean your prospect data ages fast.</p>

        <h3>Agency consolidation is relentless</h3>
        <p>Hundreds of agency M&A deals happen every year. Independent agencies join aggregators. Regional brokers get acquired by nationals. Your target account list includes agencies that no longer exist independently. Decision-making shifts to new ownership. The principal you knew might not have authority anymore.</p>

        <h3>Insurance contacts move frequently</h3>
        <p>Agency principals sell and move on. Carrier executives rotate between companies. Underwriters shift between MGAs. The decision-maker you've been nurturing might be two companies removed from where your CRM says they are.</p>

        <h3>Company structures are complex</h3>
        <p>Is it a carrier, an MGA, an agency, or a cluster? Parent companies, affiliates, and program administrators create confusion. The same organization might appear multiple times under different names. Your data doesn't reflect the actual business relationships.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought agency databases, carrier contact lists, MGA directories. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different levels of accuracy. Now you have the same company five times with conflicting information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for insurance sales. Long sales cycles and relationship-driven selling mean you can't afford to waste time pursuing agencies that were acquired or contacts who retired.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Insurance Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy insurance database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company Validation and M&A Tracking</h3>
        <p>We verify that insurance organizations still exist as independent entities, flag those that have been acquired or merged, and update records where we can identify successor organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>For insurance sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing agencies that were acquired. Know when targets have merged. Focus on organizations that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names vary or data came from different sources. We handle parent-subsidiary relationships and agency-carrier affiliations.</p>
        <p><strong>For insurance sales teams:</strong> One clean record per organization. Clear understanding of ownership structures. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Retirements and moves get flagged so you can update relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>For insurance sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current companies. Know when contacts retire or move. Maintain relationships across changes.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, types (carrier, MGA, agency, broker), and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For insurance sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by organization type. Target carriers vs. MGAs vs. agencies accurately. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Insurance Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on active organizations.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on agencies that were acquired. Every account in your database represents a real organization that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track relationship moves.</strong> When decision-makers move between organizations or retire, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people transition.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate distribution complexity.</strong> Understand agency ownership, carrier relationships, and MGA affiliations. Know who actually makes purchasing decisions.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by organization type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target carriers differently from MGAs, national brokers differently from regional agencies. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        Send us a sample of your insurance database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Insurance M&A never stops. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Insurance Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of insurance data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Carrier databases, agency contact lists, MGA/MGU data, broker contacts, insurtech startup lists, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the insurance industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you track agency acquisitions?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate company names against current data and can flag records where agencies have merged or been acquired. This is especially valuable given the rapid consolidation in the agency distribution channel.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle the carrier-agency-MGA complexity?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can help standardize organization types and clarify relationships in your data. Understanding distribution channel structures is part of what we do.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our insurance data?</h3>
          <p>Given the pace of agency M&A, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant consolidation activity in your target segments.</p>
