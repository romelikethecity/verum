        <h2>The HR Tech Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's the start of Q1. Budget season. Your sales team has a list of 200 HR leaders who expressed interest last year but didn't close. Perfect timing to re-engage.</p>

        <p>First thirty calls: five people who left the company entirely, four who moved from HR into operations, three disconnected numbers, eight voicemails to people no longer in HR, and ten actual conversations. Two of those ten say they just signed with a competitor last month.</p>

        <p>In a market where every CHRO gets pitched dozens of HR platforms, you can't afford to waste Q1 on dead data.</p>

        <h3>HR leaders moved more in the last three years than ever before</h3>
        <p>The pandemic reshuffled everything. CHROs retired early. Directors of People moved to new companies. The entire function restructured multiple times. B2B contact data decays at roughly 25% per year, and in HR, that number spiked. Your database of HR buyers is likely more outdated than you think.</p>

        <h3>Titles in HR are wildly inconsistent</h3>
        <p>VP of People at one company is Chief People Officer at another. Director of Talent Acquisition could be VP of Recruiting somewhere else. HR Business Partner means different things at different companies. When your CRM has inconsistent titles, segmentation and routing break down.</p>

        <h3>Your SDRs are researchers, not sellers</h3>
        <p>Research shows sales reps spend only 30% of their time actually selling. The rest goes to data entry, research, and administrative work. Selling to HR requires understanding each company's tech stack, their current pain points, their buying process. When your data is bad, research time doubles.</p>

        <h3>HR Tech conferences generate fast-decaying leads</h3>
        <p>You spent $40K on that HR Tech Conference booth. You collected 400 badge scans. The average attendee probably changed jobs within two years. Without fast follow-up with clean data, that investment evaporates.</p>

        <p>Every wrong phone number is a missed opportunity. Every bounced email is a competitor who got there first. Your team deserves better than a CRM full of job changers.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves HR Tech Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a full-time data analyst just to keep your CRM usable. Verum takes the decaying, inconsistent, outdated data across your systems and makes it work. We cross-reference multiple sources, verify contacts, and normalize titles. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. When a CHRO moves from one company to another, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For HR Tech teams:</strong> Stop calling people who left. Know when your champion moves to a new company. Follow the relationship.</p>

        <h3>Title Normalization</h3>
        <p>VP of People. Chief People Officer. Head of HR. We normalize inconsistent titles so your segmentation and routing actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For HR Tech teams:</strong> Route enterprise CHROs to AEs. Route mid-market HR directors to the right team. Stop misrouting based on title chaos.</p>

        <h3>HR Tech Stack Data</h3>
        <p>Who's running Workday? Who uses ADP? Who just implemented a competing ATS? We can append HR technology information so you can personalize outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>For HR Tech teams:</strong> Know who uses your integrations. Know who's on a competitor. Personalize based on actual stack.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. HR titles are especially messy. We verify and normalize what automation misses.</p>

        <h2>What HR Tech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Maximize conference ROI.</strong> Clean those badge scans within 48 hours of returning from HR Tech Conference, SHRM, or regional events. Follow up while the memory is fresh.</li>

          <li><strong>Track champion mobility.</strong> When your biggest advocate moves to a new company, that's a warm lead. Clean data lets you follow those relationships.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment properly by title and company size.</strong> With normalized titles and complete firmographics, your routing rules actually work.</li>

          <li><strong>Personalize based on tech stack.</strong> Know who's using Workday vs Oracle vs SAP. Reference actual integrations and competitive positioning.</li>

          <li><strong>Re-engage lost opportunities with clean data.</strong> That pipeline from last year? Half of those contacts may have moved. Clean the data before re-engaging.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? HubSpot? Outreach? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With high turnover in HR and 25% annual decay, this data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Why HR Tech Leaders Choose Verum</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>We do the work.</strong> This isn't another platform for your team to learn. Send us your data, get clean data back. Your SDRs stay focused on selling.</li>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Clean those conference leads before the momentum dies.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Especially important for messy HR titles.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Clean your data before HR Tech Conference, pay for that project.</li>

          <li><strong>We understand HR.</strong> The difference between a CHRO and a VP of People. HR operations vs talent acquisition. HRIS vs HCM. We know the domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About HR Tech Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich HRIS and HR tech stack data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can append information about HR software in use. Who's running Workday vs ADP, who uses which ATS, who just implemented a competitor. Useful for competitive positioning and integration conversations.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with our sales engagement platform?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, SalesLoft, and most other platforms used by HR Tech vendors. If your system can export data, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new CHRO names, that's their strength. But if you already have thousands of contacts from conferences, inbound leads, and years of outbound, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. No ongoing fees.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific requirements.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with HR Tech startups and enterprise vendors. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A CRM with 5,000 contacts has the same decay issues as one with 500,000.</p>
