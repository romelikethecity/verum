        <h2>The HR Tech Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling HR software. HRIS, ATS, payroll, learning, performance management, people analytics. Your CRM has company names and maybe a general contact. That's not enough to run an effective sales motion.</p>

        <p>HR buyer data is notoriously difficult. CHROs change roles frequently. HR team structures vary wildly by company. Employee headcount, the most important firmographic for HR tech, is often outdated or missing. Your SDRs spend hours researching each account before they can even start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>HR contacts are hard to find</h3>
        <p>Companies don't put their CHRO's direct line on the website. LinkedIn shows titles but not contact info. HR leaders are protective of their time because everyone is trying to sell them something. Without verified direct contact data, you're not breaking through.</p>

        <h3>Headcount data is stale</h3>
        <p>For HR tech sales, employee count determines everything: pricing tier, complexity, and whether they're even a fit. But the headcount in your CRM is from whenever the record was created. Companies grow, shrink, and change. You need current data.</p>

        <h3>HR org structures are inconsistent</h3>
        <p>Some companies have a CHRO. Some have a VP of People. Some have both. Some have distributed HR with leaders for recruiting, operations, and learning all reporting to different executives. You need to understand the buying committee, not just find a single contact.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack visibility is limited</h3>
        <p>What HRIS do they use? What ATS? Payroll? LMS? If you're selling HR tech, knowing their current stack is essential for competitive positioning and integration conversations. But companies don't advertise their HR tech stack.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that HR tech sales teams need to identify, qualify, and engage target companies.</p>

        <h3>HR buyer contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for HR decision-makers. CHROs, VPs of People, Heads of HR, Talent Acquisition Directors, HRIS Managers, HR Operations leads. The people who actually buy HR technology, with contact info that works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for target HR buyers.</p>

        <h3>Buying committee mapping</h3>
        <p>HR tech purchases rarely happen with a single buyer. We map the full buying committee: HR leadership, IT stakeholders for integrations, finance for budget approval. You'll know who's involved in the decision.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multi-contact enrichment showing the full buying committee at each target account.</p>

        <h3>Employee headcount and growth</h3>
        <p>Current employee count, historical growth trends, and hiring velocity. These metrics determine pricing tier, urgency, and fit. A company that grew 50% last year has different needs than one that's flat.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Current headcount plus growth signals for qualification and prioritization.</p>

        <h3>HR tech stack</h3>
        <p>HRIS, ATS, payroll, learning management, performance management, benefits administration. We identify what HR systems companies are running so you can qualify fit and position against competitors.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data showing current HR systems across key categories.</p>

        <h3>Hiring signals</h3>
        <p>Open job postings, especially for HR roles. Companies hiring recruiters or HR managers are often scaling and need better tools. We provide hiring data as an intent signal.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Hiring activity data indicating growth and potential budget.</p>

        <h2>What HR Tech Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Qualify by headcount.</strong> Enriched employee data lets you instantly qualify whether a company is in your target tier. Stop wasting time on companies that are too small or too large.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach actual buyers.</strong> With verified CHRO and HR leader contacts, you're reaching the people who make technology decisions, not getting lost in general HR inboxes.</li>
          <li><strong>Position against competitors.</strong> Tech stack data tells you what they're currently using. "I see you're on BambooHR" opens a different conversation than generic outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize by growth.</strong> Companies with rapid headcount growth need HR tools. Hiring signals help you focus where there's urgency and budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With the full buying committee mapped, your reps engage HR, IT, and finance simultaneously instead of single-threading.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Company names, industries, whatever accounts you're targeting. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> HR contacts? Full buying committee? Tech stack? Headcount? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What HR buyer data can you enrich?</h3>
          <p>We enrich contact records with verified work emails, direct phone numbers, job titles, and LinkedIn profiles. For HR tech sales, we focus on CHROs, VPs of HR, Heads of People, Talent Acquisition Directors, HR Operations leads, and HRIS managers.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify companies by headcount?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Employee headcount is critical for HR tech sales since it often determines pricing and fit. We enrich with current headcount, growth trends, and hiring velocity signals.</p>

          <h3>Do you have HR tech stack data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We identify what HRIS, ATS, payroll, learning management, and performance management systems companies are using. This is essential for competitive positioning and understanding integration requirements.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from LinkedIn Sales Navigator?</h3>
          <p>LinkedIn shows names and titles but not direct contact information. We provide verified work emails and direct dial phone numbers. We also enrich with firmographic and technographic data that LinkedIn doesn't have.</p>

          <h3>What about smaller companies?</h3>
          <p>Coverage varies by company size. For mid-market and enterprise companies, we typically achieve 85%+ enrichment rates for HR contacts. For smaller companies, rates are 65-80%. We'll give you expected rates before you commit.</p>
