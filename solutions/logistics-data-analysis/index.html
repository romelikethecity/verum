        <h2>The Logistics Sales Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>The logistics industry is massive and fragmented. Over 900,000 motor carriers in the US alone, plus thousands of brokers, 3PLs, and shippers. You can't pursue them all with equal intensity.</p>

        <p>Most companies selling to logistics segment by obvious factors: carrier vs. broker vs. shipper, maybe fleet size or revenue. But these broad categories hide the patterns that actually predict success. A 200-truck regional carrier might be worth 5x a 1,000-truck national fleet.</p>

        <p>Which logistics company types have the highest win rates? Where does geographic coverage correlate with deal velocity? Which segments expand after initial purchase? Your historical data contains these answers, but extracting them requires analysis most teams don't have time for.</p>

        <h3>Fleet size doesn't tell the whole story</h3>
        <p>A 500-truck refrigerated carrier and a 500-truck dry van operator have completely different technology needs, margins, and buying processes. Treating fleet size as a proxy for deal potential misses critical nuances.</p>

        <h3>Geographic coverage matters more than headcount</h3>
        <p>Regional carriers with dense lane networks often adopt technology faster than national carriers with thin coverage. Understanding geographic concentration predicts implementation success and expansion potential.</p>

        <h3>The industry consolidates constantly</h3>
        <p>M&A activity in logistics is relentless. The mid-market carrier you're targeting might be acquired next quarter. Understanding consolidation patterns helps you time outreach and identify integration opportunities.</p>

        <h2>What Logistics Data Analysis Reveals</h2>

        <p>We analyze your sales data to find actionable patterns. Not dashboards. Recommendations you can act on.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Customer Profile by Segment</h3>
        <p>Which logistics company types are your best customers? We analyze win rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, expansion revenue, and churn across segments to identify where you should focus.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Regional LTL carriers with 100&#8209;300 power units have 3x higher LTV than large national TL carriers. They implement faster and expand into more use cases."</p>

        <h3>Fleet Size and Composition Analysis</h3>
        <p>Does fleet size correlate with success? What about equipment type? We identify the sweet spots where your solution delivers the most value and stickiness.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Carriers with mixed fleets (reefer + dry van) close 40% faster than single-mode operators. They have more complex operations and higher technology adoption urgency."</p>

        <h3>Geographic Coverage Patterns</h3>
        <p>We analyze how operating authority scope and lane density correlate with buying behavior. Regional vs. national carriers have different needs and decision-making processes.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Carriers operating primarily in the Southeast close 2x faster than national carriers. Regional concentration creates operational complexity that drives technology adoption."</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Churn Indicators</h3>
        <p>Which customers expand after initial purchase? Which churn? We identify the characteristics and behaviors that predict post-sale trajectory.</p>
        <p><strong>Example finding:</strong> "Carriers that integrate ELD data within 30 days have 60% higher NRR. Delayed integrations predict eventual churn regardless of initial deal size."</p>

        <h2>Logistics-Specific Analysis Dimensions</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Company type.</strong> Asset-based carriers, freight brokers, 3PLs, shippers, freight forwarders. Each has distinct economics and buying patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Fleet size and composition.</strong> Power units, trailers, equipment types. Mixed fleets vs. specialized operations. Does size or complexity correlate with success?</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic coverage.</strong> Regional vs. national. Lane density and concentration. Operating authority scope often predicts technology fit better than revenue.</li>

          <li><strong>Service modes.</strong> TL, LTL, intermodal, final mile, specialized freight. Each mode has unique operational challenges and technology needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> TMS, ELD provider, dispatch system, accounting platform. Integration complexity varies dramatically by stack.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth trajectory.</strong> Expanding fleet, stable operations, consolidation target. Companies at different stages have different buying urgency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery call.</strong> We understand your logistics market, current segmentation approach, and the questions you're trying to answer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data intake.</strong> You share your CRM data, deal history, and customer information. We identify what analysis is possible with your dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis.</strong> We examine your data across multiple dimensions, looking for patterns that predict success. Fleet size, geographic coverage, and service modes are central to the analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Findings and recommendations.</strong> We present actionable insights: which segments to prioritize, where to reduce investment, what patterns predict success.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Implementation support.</strong> We help you translate findings into targeting criteria, lead scoring adjustments, and resource allocation changes.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What logistics data analysis do you provide?</h3>
          <p>We analyze your logistics sales data to identify your ideal customer profile, segment accounts by fleet size and geographic coverage, predict churn, and find patterns in win/loss data. The output is actionable recommendations for targeting carriers, 3PLs, and shippers.</p>

          <h3>Can you analyze performance differences between asset-based carriers and brokers?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We frequently help companies understand whether their ICP skews toward asset-based carriers, freight brokers, 3PLs, or shippers. Each segment has fundamentally different economics, technology needs, and buying processes.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle fleet size and geographic coverage analysis?</h3>
          <p>We segment carriers by power unit count, trailer count, and operating authority scope. Geographic coverage analysis includes regional vs. national carriers and lane density. Fleet composition often predicts technology adoption and deal size better than revenue alone.</p>

          <h3>What if our data is messy?</h3>
          <p>Most logistics sales data is. Carrier names change constantly due to M&A, MC numbers aren't always captured, and fleet sizes are often outdated. We can clean and enrich your data before analysis.</p>
