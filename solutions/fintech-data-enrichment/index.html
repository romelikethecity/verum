        <h2>The Fintech Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling to banks, credit unions, insurance companies, wealth managers, payment processors. Financial institutions move slowly and require long, multi-threaded sales processes. You can't afford to waste cycles on incomplete data.</p>

        <p>But financial services data is hard to get. Banks don't put their executives' direct lines on their websites. Fintech companies are notoriously private about their tech stacks. Credit unions have limited online presence. Your SDRs are spending hours researching each account before they can even start prospecting.</p>

        <h3>Contact data is buried</h3>
        <p>Financial institutions protect their executives. You might find a name and title, but good luck finding a direct email or phone number. Main lines go to gatekeepers. Generic emails go to spam folders. Without direct contact data, you're not getting through.</p>

        <h3>Organizational structures are complex</h3>
        <p>Banks have holding companies, subsidiaries, divisions, and regional structures. Who actually makes decisions? Is it at the bank level or the holding company? You need to map the buying committee across a complex org structure.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic data is scattered</h3>
        <p>Total assets, AUM, branch count, employee headcount, technology investments. The data points that determine if an institution is a fit. This information exists but it's spread across regulatory filings, press releases, and proprietary databases.</p>

        <h3>Tech stack visibility is limited</h3>
        <p>What core banking system do they run? What fraud detection? What digital banking platform? If you're selling technology to banks, knowing their current stack is essential for qualification and personalization. But banks don't advertise this.</p>

        <h3>Executive contact data</h3>

        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete org charts for target accounts with contact data for each stakeholder.</p>

        <h3>Institution firmographics</h3>
        <p>Total assets, deposits, AUM, branch count, employee headcount, geographic footprint. The metrics that determine fit and deal size. We pull from regulatory filings, industry databases, and proprietary sources.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firmographic profiles for banks, credit unions, and financial institutions.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack</h3>
        <p>Core banking systems, digital banking platforms, fraud detection, payment processing, CRM. We identify what technologies financial institutions are running so you can qualify fit and personalize outreach.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Tech stack data showing current systems in use across key categories.</p>

        <h3>Funding and growth signals (for fintechs)</h3>
        <p>If you're selling to fintech companies, we provide funding data, growth signals, hiring trends, and news coverage. Recent Series B? Adding sales team? These signals indicate budget and buying intent.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Funding history, headcount trends, and growth indicators for fintech targets.</p>

        <h2>What Fintech Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Qualify leads by institution size.</strong> Total assets and AUM tell you immediately if a bank is in your target range. Stop wasting time on institutions that are too small or too large.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With mapped org structures and multiple contacts, your reps engage the full buying committee immediately. No more single-threaded deals.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize with tech stack.</strong> "I see you're running FIS core" opens more doors than generic outreach. Tech stack data enables relevant conversations.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize by growth signals.</strong> Fintech companies that just raised are buying. Banks with innovation initiatives are open to new technology. Enriched signals help you focus where momentum exists.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce SDR research time.</strong> When data is enriched upfront, SDRs spend time selling instead of researching. More calls, more emails, more pipeline.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your list.</strong> Bank names, fintech companies, whatever accounts you're targeting. We work with Salesforce exports, HubSpot lists, or spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Tell us what you need.</strong> Executive contacts? Full org mapping? Tech stack? Firmographics? We customize enrichment to your sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We enrich.</strong> We pull from 50+ sources, cross-reference for accuracy, verify all contact data, and run human QA. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get enriched data.</strong> Import-ready file with all new fields. Your SDRs start working enriched accounts immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What financial services data can you enrich?</h3>
          <p>We enrich B2B contact and company data for fintech sales teams. This includes verified emails and direct dials for banking executives, firmographic data like AUM and branch count for financial institutions, technology stack data, and funding information for fintech companies. We don't provide consumer financial data or transaction information.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify decision-makers at banks?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We map organizational structures and identify key roles: CIO, CTO, Chief Digital Officer, Head of Innovation, VP of Operations, compliance leadership, and more. For each target institution, we can build out the buying committee with verified contact information.</p>

          <h3>Do you have data on credit unions and community banks?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Our coverage includes the full range of financial institutions: money center banks, regional banks, community banks, credit unions, and savings institutions. Coverage for smaller institutions varies, but we typically achieve 70-80% enrichment rates even for community banks.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying bank contact lists?</h3>
          <p>We enrich your existing leads and accounts rather than selling generic contact lists. Pricing is per-project, not annual subscriptions. And you own the enriched data forever. We're improving data you already have context on, not starting you from scratch with cold leads.</p>

          <h3>What about international financial institutions?</h3>
          <p>Our strongest coverage is US financial institutions. We have reasonable coverage for UK, Canada, and Western Europe. Coverage varies for other regions. We'll tell you expected match rates for your specific list before you commit.</p>
