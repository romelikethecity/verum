        <h2>The Fintech Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's Thursday afternoon. Your SDR is working a list of CFOs at mid-market companies. Perfect ICP. The kind of prospects who actually need your payment automation platform.</p>

        <p>First call: "Sarah left six months ago." Second call: wrong number. Third call: the company was acquired, now part of a larger org with a completely different tech stack. Fourth call: finally connects, but they've already signed with a competitor. The deal was closed while your data was rotting.</p>

        <p>In fintech, this happens constantly. The industry moves too fast for static data.</p>

        <h3>Your prospect data is decaying faster than you think</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.landbase.com/blog/data-decay-rate-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landbase research</a>, B2B contact databases experience decay rates between 22.5% and 70.3% annually, with email lists decaying at 28% per year. In fintech specifically, the churn is even worse. Job changes, layoffs, pivots, acquisitions. By the time your SDR calls that "fresh" lead, there's a decent chance the person doesn't work there anymore.</p>

        <h3>Data silos are killing your visibility</h3>
        <p>In most fintech companies, data lives in at least three places that don't talk to each other. Your CRM, your payment platform, and your product analytics. Maybe more if you're doing compliance reporting. Each system has its own version of the truth. Your sales team sees one picture. Finance sees another. Nobody trusts the numbers.</p>

        <h3>The cost adds up fast</h3>
        <p>Gartner research indicates that organizations lose an average of $12.9 million per year due to poor data quality. Targeting errors. Wasted outreach. Compliance issues from sending communications to the wrong contacts. Missed opportunities because your data said a company wasn't a fit when it actually was.</p>

        <h3>High churn makes everything harder</h3>
        <p>B2B fintech companies report roughly 26% annual churn. That's the highest of any B2B tech vertical. Your customers are leaving, your prospects are changing jobs, and the market is consolidating. Standing still means falling behind.</p>

        <p>Every bad data point is a wasted call, a bounced email, or worse, a compliance risk. Your reps deserve better than spending half their day verifying information that should already be accurate.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Fintech Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a dedicated ops person just to keep your CRM usable. Verum takes the decaying, siloed, inconsistent data across your systems and makes it work. We cross-reference multiple sources, flag the problems, and fix them. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. When someone moves from Stripe to a Series B startup, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For fintech teams:</strong> Stop calling people who left. Stop emailing addresses that bounce. Your SDRs spend time selling, not researching.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Funding status? Tech stack? We append what's missing so your targeting actually works. Know which prospects just raised a Series B and might finally have budget.</p>
        <p><strong>For fintech teams:</strong> Spot funding signals before your competitors. Identify companies whose tech stack makes them a perfect fit. Prioritize prospects who can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication and Unification</h3>
        <p>The same company appearing as "Acme Finance," "Acme Financial," and "ACME Fin" across your systems? We merge them into one clean record with complete history. No more fragmented data, no more confused reporting.</p>
        <p><strong>For fintech teams:</strong> Finally see accurate pipeline numbers. Stop double-counting opportunities. Know exactly where you stand with each account.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Fintech data is too important for "probably right." We catch the edge cases that automated systems miss.</p>

        <h2>What Fintech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Cut prospecting research time by 80%.</strong> SDRs stop spending two hours a day verifying contacts. The data is already clean. They just call.</li>

          <li><strong>Improve email deliverability overnight.</strong> When 28% of your list is bouncing, campaigns fail. Clean data means your messages actually land.</li>

          <li><strong>Spot funding signals before competitors.</strong> Know which prospects just raised and might have new budget. Reach out while the timing is right.</li>

          <li><strong>Track account movement across the market.</strong> When your champion leaves for a new company, you know within days. Follow the relationship, don't lose it.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline numbers.</strong> When duplicates are merged and records are accurate, forecasting actually works. No more surprise misses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data. We'll show you where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? HubSpot? Custom CRM with Stripe integration? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 28% annual decay, fintech data needs regular maintenance. We can run monthly or quarterly refreshes. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Fintech Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you help with compliance data requirements?</h3>
          <p>We enrich firmographic and contact data, not regulated financial data. But accurate company information helps with KYC verification, and clean contact data ensures compliance communications reach the right people. We're not a compliance tool, but we make your compliance processes work better.</p>

          <h3>Do you have funding and investment data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can append funding round information, investor names, and growth signals. Know which companies just raised and might have new budget for your solution.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new names for cold outreach, that's their strength. But if you already have thousands of contacts from years of sales activity, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have. We enrich specific data points you're missing.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year depending on seats and features. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh in six months? Pay for that refresh. No ongoing fees eating your budget while you're not actively using it.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> This is the one most people don't realize until it's too late. ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete all their data if you terminate your contract. Every contact, every enrichment field, gone. You never actually own what you paid for. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours. Forever. Cancel anytime, keep everything.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand fintech security requirements. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific needs.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with fintech companies from seed stage to public. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A 20-person payments startup has the same CRM decay issues as a 2,000-person neobank.</p>
