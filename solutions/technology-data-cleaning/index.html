        <h2>The Technology Sales Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell software, services, or hardware to technology companies. Your CRM contains enterprise tech vendors, MSPs, VARs, IT consulting firms, and tech-forward enterprises. But the technology landscape shifts constantly.</p>

        <p>That mid-sized tech company you've been cultivating? Acquired by a larger player last quarter. The CTO you built a relationship with? Jumped to a competitor offering more equity. The growing tech vendor on your target list? Pivoted to a different market. Your database reflects a technology landscape that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Technology data has unique challenges. Constant M&A activity, competitive talent markets, and rapid organizational changes mean your prospect data goes stale faster than most industries.</p>

        <h3>Tech M&A never stops</h3>
        <p>Technology companies acquire competitors, get bought by larger players, and merge constantly. That target account might now be part of a bigger organization with different buying processes. Your database includes companies that no longer exist independently or have been absorbed into larger entities.</p>

        <h3>Tech executives are highly mobile</h3>
        <p>CTOs, VPs of Engineering, IT Directors, and technology leaders move frequently. Stock options vest, startups compete for talent, and career advancement drives constant movement. The decision-maker you've been nurturing might be at a completely different company than your CRM shows.</p>

        <h3>Tech structures reorganize constantly</h3>
        <p>Technology organizations restructure after acquisitions, layoffs, and strategic pivots. Engineering teams get reorganized. IT departments centralize or decentralize. The org chart from six months ago might be completely obsolete, and decision-making authority has shifted.</p>

        <h3>Purchased lists compound the problem</h3>
        <p>You've bought tech company databases, IT decision-maker lists, vendor directories. Each list has different naming conventions, different ages, different accuracy levels. Now you have the same company five times with conflicting information.</p>

        <p>Clean data is essential for technology sales. Technical buyers research thoroughly and expect precision. You can't afford to waste their time—or yours—pursuing acquired companies or departed contacts.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Technology Sales Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy technology database and make it work for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Company Validation and M&A Tracking</h3>
        <p>We verify that technology companies still exist as independent entities, flag those that have been acquired or merged, and update records where we can identify successor organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>For technology sales teams:</strong> Stop pursuing companies that were acquired. Know when targets have merged. Focus on organizations that can actually buy.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names vary or data came from different sources. We handle name changes, rebrands, and parent-subsidiary relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>For technology sales teams:</strong> One clean record per company. Clear understanding of corporate structures. No more confusion about which record to use.</p>

        <h3>Contact Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses, check for job changes, and validate that contacts are still at the companies you think they are. Departures and moves get flagged so you can update relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>For technology sales teams:</strong> Reach decision-makers at their current companies. Know when contacts move. Follow relationships across the tech ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize company names, categories (enterprise vendor, MSP, VAR, consulting), and job titles into consistent formats. Your segmentation and targeting actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For technology sales teams:</strong> Build reliable segments by company type and size. Target enterprise tech differently from MSPs. Analytics you can trust.</p>

        <h2>What Technology Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Focus on active companies.</strong> Stop wasting cycles on tech companies that were acquired or shut down. Every account in your database represents a real company that can buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Track executive moves.</strong> When decision-makers move between companies, you know about it. Maintain relationships even as people transition across the tech industry.</li>

          <li><strong>Segment by company type accurately.</strong> Clean data lets you target enterprise tech vendors differently from MSPs, IT consultants differently from VARs. Messages resonate because they're relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Navigate corporate structures.</strong> Understand parent-subsidiary relationships and which entities make which decisions. Know where purchasing authority actually sits.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline.</strong> Deduplicated, validated data means your pipeline represents real opportunities. Forecasting works when underlying data is accurate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your technology database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Tech M&A and turnover never stop. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database current. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Technology Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of technology data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Tech company databases, IT vendor contacts, enterprise technology lists, MSP and VAR contacts, and any B2B data your sales team uses to reach the technology industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you track tech company acquisitions and mergers?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We validate company names against current data and can flag records where tech companies have been acquired or merged. This is especially valuable given the constant M&A activity in technology.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>Can you help segment by company type?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can help standardize company classifications so you can accurately target enterprise vendors vs. MSPs vs. VARs vs. IT consultants.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean our technology data?</h3>
          <p>Given the pace of M&A and turnover in tech, quarterly cleaning is ideal. At minimum, clean before major campaigns and after significant industry consolidation in your target segments.</p>
