        <h2>The Technology Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>Tech companies accumulate data fast. Product signups, free trials, webinar registrations, event leads, inbound forms. The volume is great for pipeline, but it creates massive data quality challenges that compound over time.</p>

        <p>Technology has unique data decay patterns. Startups get acquired or shut down. People change jobs frequently. Companies rebrand. And PLG motion means you're collecting data from freemium users who sign up with personal emails. Your CRM becomes a mess of duplicates, outdated records, and unqualified leads.</p>

        <h3>Personal emails everywhere</h3>
        <p>Product-led growth is great for adoption, but it fills your database with gmail.com and outlook.com addresses. You can't run effective outreach to personal emails, and you don't know which companies these users actually represent.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates from multiple touchpoints</h3>
        <p>The same person signed up for your product, attended your webinar, downloaded a whitepaper, and visited your booth. Now you have four records with slightly different information. Your SDRs don't know which one to use.</p>

        <h3>Startups change constantly</h3>
        <p>The company you added last year got acquired. Or rebranded. Or pivoted entirely. Or shut down. Tech moves fast, and your CRM data ages faster than any other industry.</p>

        <h3>Job changes are constant</h3>
        <p>Tech has some of the highest job mobility. The VP of Engineering you talked to is now at a competitor. The developer advocate moved to a startup. Every job change creates a stale record and potentially a missed opportunity at their new company.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Technology Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the specific challenges of technology company data. High-velocity lead generation. PLG user databases. Frequent company changes. We clean your data to make it actually useful for sales and marketing.</p>

        <h3>Lead deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match leads across emails, company domains, and name variations. We handle the complexity of personal emails by grouping users to companies where possible. The result is clean, deduplicated lead records.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per lead with complete engagement history preserved.</p>

        <h3>Personal email enrichment</h3>
        <p>For leads who signed up with personal emails, we identify their work email and company when possible. This transforms unusable personal email leads into qualified B2B contacts.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Work emails and company attribution for previously unidentifiable leads.</p>

        <h3>Company validation</h3>
        <p>We verify that companies still exist, haven't been acquired, and are operating under the name you have. We flag dead companies, acquisitions, and rebrands so you're not wasting time on leads that can't convert.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Validated company data with acquisition and status flags.</p>

        <h3>Email validation</h3>
        <p>We verify every email for deliverability. Tech companies have strict email security, and bad emails hurt your sender reputation. We flag invalid addresses before they cause bounces.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails.</p>

        <h2>What Tech Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Convert PLG users to sales leads.</strong> When personal email users are enriched with work contacts, you can run proper outbound to your best product users.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce email bounces.</strong> Validated emails protect your sender reputation and improve deliverability across all campaigns.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop wasting time on dead leads.</strong> When acquired or defunct companies are flagged, your SDRs focus on opportunities that can actually close.</li>
          <li><strong>Run accurate attribution.</strong> Clean, deduplicated data means your marketing attribution actually shows what's working.</li>
          <li><strong>Track job changes as opportunities.</strong> Clean data shows when contacts have moved, creating opportunities to reach out at their new companies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull leads from your CRM or marketing automation platform. We work with exports from Salesforce, HubSpot, Marketo, Segment, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze duplicate rates, personal email percentages, company validation issues, and email health. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, personal email enrichment. Human review on edge cases. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate data immediately.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle startup company duplicates?</h3>

          <h3>What about event and webinar leads?</h3>
          <p>Event data often has the worst quality due to badge scans and quick form fills. We clean event leads by validating emails, deduplicating across events, and standardizing company data.</p>
