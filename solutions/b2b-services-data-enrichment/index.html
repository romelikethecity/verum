        <h2>The B2B Services Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's Monday morning. You need to pull together a client review for your biggest account. Revenue numbers, project history, key contacts, upcoming renewals. Should be straightforward.</p>

        <p>Your CRM says the main contact is Jennifer, VP of Operations. Your project management tool has three different Jennifers, none with VP titles. Your billing system shows invoices going to someone named Michael who you've never heard of. The company name is spelled differently in each system.</p>

        <p>Two hours later, you've cross-referenced everything manually and built a spreadsheet you're still not confident about. The client meeting is in an hour.</p>

        <h3>Client data lives in too many places</h3>
        <p>CRM, project management, billing, time tracking, email. Every system has a version of your client data, and none of them agree. The CRM was updated by sales, the project tool by delivery, the billing system by finance. Nobody owns the single source of truth because there isn't one.</p>

        <h3>Contact decay hits service businesses hard</h3>
        <p>Research shows 30% of B2B contacts go stale every year. For service businesses built on relationships, that's devastating. The client champion who loved your work got promoted. The decision-maker who signed your last contract moved to a competitor. Your carefully built relationship maps are decaying while you watch.</p>

        <h3>Cross-sell and upsell analysis takes forever</h3>
        <p>You know there's more business in your existing clients. But identifying which ones might need additional services requires pulling data from five systems, normalizing it, and hoping the analysis is right. By the time you've done it for one client, you've burned half a day.</p>

        <h3>Client turnover creates onboarding nightmares</h3>
        <p>When your client's team changes, you need to rebuild relationships fast. But your contact data doesn't tell you who the new stakeholders are, who has authority, or who you should be talking to. You're starting cold with a warm account.</p>

        <p>Every hour spent reconciling data across systems is an hour not spent serving clients. Every wrong email is a relationship signal missed. Your team deserves better than a data archaeology expedition every time they need basic client information.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves B2B Services Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a data analyst on staff just to know who your client contacts are. Verum takes exports from your CRM, project tools, and billing systems, and turns them into unified, accurate client records. We cross-reference, deduplicate, and enrich. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. When a client stakeholder moves to a new role, we catch it.</p>
        <p><strong>For B2B services teams:</strong> Know when your champion gets promoted or leaves. Keep relationships alive even when people change jobs.</p>

        <h3>Record Unification Across Systems</h3>
        <p>"Acme Corp" in your CRM. "ACME Corporation" in billing. "Acme" in the project tool. Same client, three different records. We unify them so you can see the complete relationship.</p>
        <p><strong>For B2B services teams:</strong> Get a single view of each client across all your systems. No more reconciliation gymnastics.</p>

        <h3>Client Intelligence Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Industry vertical? We fill in the gaps so your targeting and segmentation actually work. Know which clients are growing and might need more services.</p>
        <p><strong>For B2B services teams:</strong> Segment clients by potential, not just current revenue. Identify expansion opportunities before they go to competitors.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. Service businesses have complexity. Holding companies, subsidiaries, multiple divisions using different names. We catch what algorithms miss.</p>

        <h2>What B2B Services Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Prepare for client meetings in minutes.</strong> Pull complete client histories without the system-hopping scavenger hunt. Know the full relationship before you walk in the door.</li>

          <li><strong>Identify cross-sell opportunities faster.</strong> See which clients are growing, which have unmet needs, which might be ready for additional services. Prioritize outreach with data, not guesswork.</li>

          <li><strong>Track stakeholder changes proactively.</strong> When your client champion moves roles, you'll know. When new decision-makers join, you can build relationships before competitors do.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce time-to-invoice.</strong> When client data matches across systems, billing goes out faster. Fewer corrections, fewer disputes, faster payment.</li>

          <li><strong>Onboard new team members faster.</strong> Give new account managers a complete view of client relationships from day one. No more months of discovery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of where your biggest gaps likely are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. Salesforce? HubSpot? Monday? We've seen them all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        With 30% annual decay, client data needs regular maintenance. We can run quarterly refreshes to keep things current. Or not. Your call.</p>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Clean your data before the quarterly review, not after.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Project-based pricing fits service business cash flows.</li>

          <li><strong>We understand services businesses.</strong> The difference between a retainer and a project. Account managers versus delivery leads. Multi-year relationships with evolving stakeholders. We know the domain.</li>

        <h2>Common Questions About B2B Services Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Can you work with our existing CRM and project management tools?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Salesforce, HubSpot, Monday, Asana, ClickUp, and most major platforms. If your system can export data, we can clean it. We'll return it in whatever format you need for import.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle multiple contacts per client?</h3>
          <p>We preserve the full stakeholder picture while cleaning each contact. You keep visibility into all the relationships, but each one has verified, current information.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new prospect names, that's their strength. But if you already have years of client relationships and now that data is scattered across systems? That's us. We clean and unify what you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> ZoomInfo's terms require you to delete their data if you cancel. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand client data is sensitive. Happy to sign NDAs.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with companies of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with boutique agencies and large service firms. Data quality challenges are similar regardless of headcount. A CRM with 500 clients has the same decay issues as one with 50,000.</p>
