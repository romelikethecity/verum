        <h2>The B2B Services Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling consulting, agency services, or professional expertise. Your CRM has company names and maybe a general contact. That's not enough to win competitive services engagements.</p>

        <p>B2B services sales are relationship-driven. You need to reach the right executive with the right message at the right time. But decision-maker data is hard to find. Buying triggers are invisible. Your BD team spends hours researching each prospect before they can even start the conversation.</p>

        <h3>Decision-makers are hard to identify</h3>
        <p>Who buys your type of service at this company? Is it the CMO, the VP of Marketing, or the procurement team? Service buying patterns vary by company size and industry. Without knowing the right entry point, you're guessing who to contact.</p>

        <h3>Contact information is hidden</h3>
        <p>Executives protect their time. Direct phone numbers aren't published. Personal assistants screen emails. Your BD team sends messages to info@ addresses and hopes for the best. Without direct contact data, you're not breaking through.</p>

        <h3>Timing is invisible</h3>
        <p>Companies hire agencies and consultants when something changes. New leadership. Funding rounds. Reorganizations. Strategic shifts. But these triggers aren't in your CRM. You're reaching out randomly instead of when companies actually need help.</p>

        <h3>Competitive landscape is unclear</h3>
        <p>Who's their current agency? What consultancies have they worked with? Understanding incumbent relationships helps you position appropriately or identify displacement opportunities. But this intelligence takes hours to gather manually.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the data that B2B services firms need to identify, qualify, and engage prospects effectively.</p>

        <h3>Executive contacts</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for the decision-makers who buy your services. CMOs, CFOs, CIOs, VP-level leaders, procurement directors. The specific titles depend on what you sell, and we customize to your target buyer profile.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for target executives.</p>

        <h3>Company firmographics</h3>
        <p>Revenue, employee count, industry, locations, and company structure. These basics help you qualify whether a company is the right size and type for your services, and how to position your pricing and approach.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firmographic profiles enabling accurate qualification and segmentation.</p>

        <h3>Buying trigger signals</h3>
        <p>Executive changes, funding rounds, M&A activity, rapid hiring, restructuring announcements. These events often trigger services engagements. We enrich with signals that indicate a company might be in-market.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Trigger event data enabling timely, relevant outreach.</p>

        <h3>Organizational insights</h3>
        <p>Team sizes, reporting structures, and functional organization where available. Understanding how a prospect company is organized helps you identify the right stakeholders and navigate complex buying committees.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Org structure data enabling multi-threaded engagement from day one.</p>

        <h3>Competitive intelligence</h3>
        <p>Current agency relationships, consulting firm engagements, and vendor mentions where publicly available. Understanding the competitive landscape helps you position appropriately and identify displacement opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Competitive context enabling differentiated positioning.</p>

        <h2>What B2B Services Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach actual decision-makers.</strong> With verified executive contacts, you're reaching the people who can sign contracts instead of getting lost in procurement processes.</li>
          <li><strong>Time outreach to triggers.</strong> New CMO? Recent funding? Restructuring? Trigger signals help you reach out when companies are actually evaluating options.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualify by company fit.</strong> Firmographic data lets you instantly identify companies in your sweet spot by size, industry, and growth stage.</li>
          <li><strong>Position against competitors.</strong> Understanding current vendor relationships helps you differentiate and identify realistic displacement opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread complex deals.</strong> Org structure data helps you engage multiple stakeholders from the start instead of single-threading and stalling.</li>
        </ul>
