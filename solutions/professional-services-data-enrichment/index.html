        <h2>The Professional Services Lead Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're selling high-value consulting and advisory services. Strategy, operations, technology transformation, financial advisory. Your clients are senior executives who don't respond to generic outreach. You need precise targeting and personalized approaches.</p>

        <p>But executive data is hard to get. C-suite contacts protect their time. Direct lines aren't published. LinkedIn shows titles but not contact info. And by the time you've researched a target thoroughly, the window for relevant outreach may have closed.</p>

        <h3>Executive contacts are protected</h3>
        <p>CFOs, CIOs, and CHROs don't put their direct numbers online. General company lines go through gatekeepers. Generic emails get filtered. Without verified direct contact information, your partners are cold calling reception desks.</p>

        <h3>Timing matters enormously</h3>
        <p>Consulting engagements often follow trigger events: new executives, M&A announcements, funding rounds, regulatory changes. By the time these are public knowledge, competitors may already be in conversations. You need to know about triggers as they happen.</p>

        <h3>Company context is fragmented</h3>
        <p>What initiatives is the company pursuing? What's their current strategic focus? Who are the key stakeholders? This context lives across news articles, press releases, and industry publications. Nobody has time to compile it manually for every target.</p>

        <h3>Decision-makers are distributed</h3>
        <p>A transformation engagement might involve the CEO, CFO, CIO, and COO. You need the full buying committee, not just a single contact. And you need to understand reporting relationships and influence dynamics.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See What's Missing From Your Data</a>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <p>We specialize in the specific data that professional services firms need to identify, qualify, and engage target clients.</p>

        <h3>C-suite contact data</h3>
        <p>Verified work emails and direct phone numbers for senior executives. CEOs, CFOs, CIOs, COOs, CHROs, and their direct reports. The decision-makers who engage consulting firms, with contact information that actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverable emails and direct dials where available for executive contacts.</p>

        <h3>Buying committee mapping</h3>
        <p>We identify the full stakeholder group for typical consulting engagements. Not just one contact, but the executive team members who would be involved in a transformation decision. You'll know who to engage and their reporting relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multi-contact enrichment showing key stakeholders and organizational structure.</p>

        <h3>Trigger event data</h3>
        <p>Leadership changes, M&A activity, funding rounds, expansion announcements, strategic initiatives. We identify events that often precede consulting engagements so you can time outreach appropriately.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Trigger signals indicating potential consulting buying moments.</p>

        <h3>Company firmographics</h3>
        <p>Revenue, employee count, growth trajectory, geographic footprint, industry classification. The metrics that help you qualify fit and size the opportunity appropriately.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Complete firmographic profiles for target companies.</p>

        <h3>Strategic context</h3>
        <p>Current initiatives, announced priorities, and public strategic direction. This context enables personalized outreach that demonstrates understanding of the company's situation.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Company context enabling relevant, personalized business development.</p>

        <h2>What Professional Services Teams Do With Enriched Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Reach executives directly.</strong> With verified direct contact information, partners connect with decision-makers instead of getting lost in gatekeepers.</li>
          <li><strong>Time outreach to triggers.</strong> Trigger event data lets you reach out when companies are most likely to be considering consulting engagements.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalize at scale.</strong> Company context and strategic initiative data enables relevant outreach that demonstrates understanding of the prospect's situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-thread from day one.</strong> With the full buying committee mapped, partners can engage multiple stakeholders simultaneously.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize high-potential targets.</strong> Firmographic and trigger data helps partners focus on companies with the highest engagement potential.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What executive contact data can you enrich?</h3>
          <p>We enrich contact records with verified work emails, direct phone numbers, job titles, and LinkedIn profiles. For professional services business development, we focus on C-suite executives, VPs, and senior directors who typically engage consulting and advisory firms.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify companies likely to buy consulting services?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We enrich with signals that indicate consulting buying propensity: recent funding rounds, leadership changes, M&A activity, expansion plans, and digital transformation initiatives.</p>

          <h3>Do you have data on mid-market companies?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Our coverage spans enterprise to mid-market. For Fortune 500, we typically achieve 90%+ enrichment rates. For mid-market companies, rates are 75-85%. We'll give you expected rates for your specific list.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from LinkedIn Sales Navigator?</h3>
          <p>LinkedIn shows names and titles but not direct contact information. We provide verified emails and direct dials. We also enrich with firmographic and trigger data that LinkedIn doesn't have.</p>

          <h3>Can you provide assistant contact information?</h3>
          <p>Yes. For many C-suite executives, we can also provide executive assistant contacts. Sometimes the EA is the most effective path to the decision-maker.</p>
