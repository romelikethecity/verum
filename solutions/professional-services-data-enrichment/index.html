        <h2>The Professional Services Data Problem</h2>

        <p>It's Monday morning. You're a partner prepping for a QBR with your firm's biggest client. $2.3M in annual revenue. You need engagement metrics, cross-sell opportunities, maybe a few talking points about value delivered.</p>

        <p>You open Salesforce. Last interaction logged was four months ago. Half the executive team has email addresses that bounce. Your practice management system shows 12 active matters. Your billing system shows 9.</p>

        <p>Three hours later, you've called two associates, dug through four systems, and built a spreadsheet you still don't fully trust. The meeting's in an hour.</p>

        <p>This scenario plays out every week at professional services firms. The data exists. It's just scattered, decaying, and contradictory.</p>

        <h3>Client intelligence scattered everywhere</h3>
        <p>CRM, practice management, billing, time tracking. Each system holds a piece of the puzzle. According to <a href="https://www.validity.com/resource-center/state-of-crm-data-health-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Validity's 2025 State of CRM Data Health report</a>, workers spend 13 hours per week just hunting for basic information in their CRM. That's a quarter of someone's week. Gone.</p>

        <h3>Contact decay eating your relationships</h3>
        <p>People change jobs. It's what they do. Research consistently shows 30% of your contacts will have new roles within a year. That CFO email sitting in your CRM has a one-in-three chance of being wrong already. Your renewal proposal sits unread. Your cross-sell opportunity goes to a competitor who had the right number.</p>

        <h3>Cross-sell analysis that takes days instead of minutes</h3>
        <p>You know there's more business in your existing clients. Everyone does. But pulling together engagement history, service gaps, and relationship health across systems takes so long that by the time you've done it, the opportunity has moved on. A consulting firm found they were leaving 23% of potential revenue on the table simply because partners couldn't see what other services clients might need.</p>

        <h3>Duplicate records creating billing chaos</h3>
        <p>"Acme Corp." "Acme Corporation." "ACME Co." Same client, three records, fragmented history. The result is embarrassing billing errors, revenue attribution that's basically fiction, and partners who can't see the full picture of relationships they're supposed to be managing.</p>

        <p>The real cost is partners wasting 500+ hours yearly on data reconciliation instead of client development. That's 62 working days. Roughly a quarter of someone's capacity. Meanwhile, missed cross-sell opportunities and declining client retention chip away at the revenue that's supposed to justify all those billable hours.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Professional Services Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>You shouldn't need a data analyst on staff just to know which clients need attention. Verum takes the scattered, decaying, duplicate-riddled data across your systems and turns it into something you can actually use. We do it in days, not months.</p>

        <h3>Unified Client Records</h3>
        <p>We connect your CRM, practice management platform, billing system, and time tracking tools. Then we merge and deduplicate records so every client appears once, with complete history. No more debates about which system is right.</p>
        <p><strong>For professional services:</strong> See total relationship value across all matters, partners, and service lines in one view. Know instantly whether that $800K client is actually a $2M relationship when you count all the work across practice areas.</p>

        <h3>Contact Data That Stays Fresh</h3>
        <p>Our AI cross-references your contacts against 50+ data sources, flagging job changes, updating emails, and filling in missing phone numbers. We catch the 30% annual decay before it catches you.</p>
        <p><strong>For professional services:</strong> Stop sending renewal proposals to people who left six months ago. Know when your champion at a client just got promoted, and congratulate them before your competitor does.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>
        <p>Missing company size? Revenue range? Industry classification? We append what's missing so your targeting and segmentation actually work.</p>
        <p><strong>For professional services:</strong> Know which clients are growing and might need more services versus which are contracting and might need extra attention. Spot the acquisition before it's announced. See funding rounds that signal budget increases.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>
        <p>AI does the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before it goes back to you. "Pretty good" data isn't good enough when client relationships are on the line. Our team catches the edge cases that algorithms miss.</p>

        <h2>What Professional Services Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Identify cross-sell opportunities in minutes.</strong> See complete engagement history across all clients, flag service gaps, and know exactly which partner has the strongest relationship to make the introduction.</li>

          <li><strong>Reduce time-to-invoice by 40%.</strong> When project data, billing data, and client records actually match, invoices go out faster. Less back-and-forth. Fewer corrections. Faster payment.</li>

          <li><strong>Spot at-risk clients 3 months earlier.</strong> Declining engagement patterns, unanswered emails, missed meetings. Clean data lets you see the warning signs while there's still time to act.</li>

          <li><strong>Calculate accurate client lifetime value.</strong> Stop guessing which clients are actually profitable. Know which relationships deserve partner attention and which ones don't justify the investment.</li>

          <li><strong>Onboard new partners without the data scavenger hunt.</strong> Give incoming partners a complete view of their inherited relationships from day one. No more spending the first month just figuring out who the clients are.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Less Time Than Your Average Meeting</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Take our <a href="/#contact">data quality assessment</a>. We'll show you where your biggest gaps are. No commitment, no sales pitch.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your tech stack, data sources, and specific challenges. You'll leave with a clear picture of what's possible. Most firms use some combination of Salesforce or Dynamics, a practice management tool like Kantata or Clio, and separate billing software. We've seen it all.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample file. We'll clean and enrich it so you can see the before-and-after yourself. No cost, no obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Engagement</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your full dataset. Most projects wrap in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>
        Data decays constantly. We can run monthly or quarterly refreshes to keep things clean. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Why Professional Services Leaders Choose Verum</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>We do the work.</strong> This isn't another platform to learn. Send us your data, get clean data back. Your team stays focused on clients, not software.</li>

          <li><strong>Fast turnaround.</strong> 24-48 hours for most projects. Not weeks. Not months.</li>

          <li><strong>Human verification.</strong> AI handles scale. Humans handle judgment. Every project gets both.</li>

          <li><strong>No long-term contracts.</strong> Pay for what you need, when you need it. Project-based pricing means you're not locked in.</li>

          <li><strong>We've seen your exact problem before.</strong> Professional services data has specific quirks. Matters vs. projects vs. cases. Multiple billing partners on a single client. Origination credits that don't match reality. We know them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About Professional Services Data Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
          <p>There isn't really an "implementation." Send us a file, we send back clean data. First project typically completes in 24-48 hours. Ongoing integrations take a bit longer to set up, but we're talking days, not months.</p>

          <h3>Does this work with our practice management software?</h3>
          <p>Almost certainly. We've worked with Kantata, BigTime, Clio, PracticePanther, BQE, and most major CRMs including Salesforce and Dynamics. If your system can export data, we can clean it.</p>

          <h3>What kind of ROI should we expect?</h3>
          <p>Depends on your situation. If partner time costs $400/hour and you're saving 10 hours/month on data reconciliation, that's $48K/year. Most firms see payback in the first month. The cross-sell opportunities alone usually cover the cost.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences:</p>
          <p><strong>Different problem.</strong> ZoomInfo sells access to their contact database. If you need net-new names and phone numbers for cold outreach, that's their strength. But if you already have thousands of contacts from ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lusha, or years of business development, and now that data is a mess? That's us. We clean and organize what you have. We enrich specific data points you're missing, like company revenue, tech stack, or funding status. Different starting point, different outcome.</p>
          <p><strong>Different pricing.</strong> ZoomInfo charges recurring annual licenses, typically $15K-$50K+ per year depending on seats and features. We charge per project. Clean your data once, pay once. Need a refresh in six months? Pay for that refresh. No ongoing fees eating your budget while you're not actively using it.</p>
          <p><strong>Different ownership.</strong> This is the one most people don't realize until it's too late. ZoomInfo's licensing terms require you to delete all their data if you terminate your contract. Every contact, every enrichment field, gone. You never actually own what you paid for. With Verum, your cleaned data is yours. Forever. Cancel anytime, keep everything.</p>

          <h3>What about data security?</h3>
          <p>Encrypted transfers, no data sharing with third parties, deletion after project completion unless you request otherwise. We understand professional services confidentiality requirements. Happy to sign NDAs or discuss specific compliance needs.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with firms of our size?</h3>
          <p>We work with firms from 10 people to 10,000. Data problems don't discriminate by headcount. A 50-person consulting firm has the same fragmented CRM challenge as a 5,000-attorney law firm. The scale changes, the problems don't.</p>
