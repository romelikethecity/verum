        <h2>The Construction Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You sell to contractors, developers, or construction companies. Your database has thousands of records. But when your sales team actually tries to use it, the problems start.</p>

        <p>Phone numbers that ring disconnected. Emails that bounce. Contacts who left the company two years ago. Companies that went out of business. Your reps waste hours chasing dead leads while real opportunities sit buried in the noise.</p>

        <p>Construction industry data is uniquely challenging. And most companies just accept the mess.</p>

        <h3>Construction companies change constantly</h3>
        <p>Contractors form new companies, dissolve old ones, merge with partners. The GC you quoted last year might be operating under a different name now. Your database doesn't know. Your reps keep calling the old number, wondering why nobody picks up.</p>

        <h3>Contact information goes stale fast</h3>
        <p>Project managers move between firms. Estimators get promoted. Owners retire. The construction industry has high turnover at every level. That contact list you bought six months ago? A quarter of it is already outdated.</p>

        <h3>Phone numbers are particularly unreliable</h3>
        <p>Construction runs on phone calls, not emails. But your phone data is the worst. Cell numbers change. Office lines get disconnected. Wrong numbers pile up. Your reps dial ten numbers to reach one person.</p>

        <h3>Duplicates multiply across sources</h3>
        <p>Same contractor in your database five times. Once from a trade show. Once from permit data. Once from a project bid. Once from a referral. Once from a purchased list. Different phone numbers, different spellings, different contact names. Nobody knows which record is right.</p>

        <p>Bad data doesn't just slow down your sales team. It costs you deals. While your reps chase dead leads, your competitors with clean data are already talking to decision-makers.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Construction Data</h2>

        <p>We take your messy contractor databases and make them usable for sales. No software to implement. No integration project. Export your data, send it over, get clean data back. Usually in a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Phone Number Validation</h3>
        <p>We check every phone number against carrier databases. Disconnected numbers, wrong numbers, and landlines-turned-cell get flagged or corrected. Your reps dial numbers that actually ring.</p>
        <p><strong>For construction sales teams:</strong> More conversations per hour. Less time listening to "this number is no longer in service." Higher connect rates on cold calls.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across All Sources</h3>
        <p>Our AI identifies duplicate records even when company names are spelled differently or data came from different sources. We merge intelligently, keeping the most accurate and complete information.</p>
        <p><strong>For construction sales teams:</strong> One clean record per company. No more calling the same contractor three times from three different records. Clear account ownership.</p>

        <h3>Company Validation</h3>
        <p>We verify company names against business registries, check for name changes and mergers, and validate that contractors are still operating. Dead companies get flagged so you stop wasting time on them.</p>
        <p><strong>For construction sales teams:</strong> Focus on active companies. Stop chasing contractors who closed shop. Know when companies have merged or rebranded.</p>

        <h3>Contact Standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize job titles, company names, addresses, and every other field into consistent formats. "Pres" becomes "President." "Gen Contractor" becomes "General Contractor." Your segmentation actually works.</p>
        <p><strong>For construction sales teams:</strong> Target by role accurately. Find all the estimators, all the project managers, all the owners. Personalization that doesn't look broken.</p>

        <h2>What Construction Sales Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Make more dials that connect.</strong> When phone numbers are validated, your reps spend time talking instead of listening to disconnected messages. Call efficiency goes up immediately.</li>

          <li><strong>Focus on active opportunities.</strong> Stop wasting time on companies that closed or contacts who left. Every record in your database represents a real sales opportunity.</li>

          <li><strong>Target the right decision-makers.</strong> Clean, standardized job titles mean your targeting actually works. Reach estimators when you want estimators. Reach owners when you want owners.</li>

          <li><strong>Avoid duplicate outreach.</strong> When duplicates are merged, you stop embarrassing yourself by calling the same contractor from multiple records. Your team looks professional.</li>

          <li><strong>Trust your pipeline numbers.</strong> Clean data means accurate reporting. Know how many real opportunities you have, not how many duplicate records exist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started Takes Minutes</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Tell us about your data situation. We'll give you an honest picture of what cleaning can realistically accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We look at your data sources. CRM export? Purchased list? Permit data? We've worked with all types of construction industry data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Sample Cleaning (on us)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your contractor database. We'll clean it so you can see exactly what the results look like. No cost, no commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Project</strong><br>
        Once you're ready, we process your complete dataset. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance (optional)</strong><br>
        Construction data goes stale fast. We can run quarterly cleaning to keep your database fresh. Or not. Your call.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Construction Data Cleaning</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets might take a few days. We'll give you a realistic timeline before we start.</p>

          <h3>What types of construction data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Contractor databases, developer lists, subcontractor contacts, supplier records, permit data extracts, and any B2B data you use to reach the construction industry.</p>

          <h3>Can you validate contractor license information?</h3>
          <p>We validate company names against business registries and can flag records for license verification. For active license status checking, we recommend pairing our cleaning with state licensing board lookups, which vary by state.</p>

          <h3>What file formats do you work with?</h3>
          <p>CSV, Excel, database exports. If your CRM or system can export it, we can clean it. We return data in whatever format works for your import.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle the same company with multiple locations?</h3>
          <p>We can either merge to a single record or keep locations separate with standardized parent company information. We'll discuss your preference during the discovery call.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean data from permit databases?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Permit data is notoriously messy with inconsistent company names and outdated contact info. We can standardize and validate it like any other data source.</p>
