        <h2>The Construction Data Quality Problem</h2>

        <p>You're a general contractor, construction supplier, or service provider to the industry. Your CRM and project management systems hold years of contractor, subcontractor, and project contact data. But that data has become unreliable.</p>

        <p>Construction has unique data challenges. Subcontractors work under different DBAs. Estimators and project managers move between companies constantly. License and insurance information expires. And every project brings in new contacts that get added without checking for duplicates. Your team wastes time verifying information instead of bidding and building.</p>

        <h3>Subcontractors are duplicated everywhere</h3>
        <p>"ABC Electrical" and "ABC Electric LLC" and "ABC Electrical Services" are all in your database. Maybe they're the same company. Maybe they're different. When you're putting together a bid, you can't easily see that contractor's full project history because it's scattered across duplicate records.</p>

        <h3>Contacts are constantly moving</h3>
        <p>The estimator who worked on your last project is now at a competitor. The project manager retired. Construction has high mobility, and every job change creates stale contact data. You're reaching out to people who haven't been at that company in years.</p>

        <h3>License and insurance data is stale</h3>
        <p>Contractor licenses expire. Insurance certificates lapse. Your approved vendor list shows credentials that were current two years ago. Compliance requirements mean you need current data, but manual verification is time-consuming.</p>

        <h3>Trade classifications are inconsistent</h3>
        <p>Is this contractor "electrical" or "low voltage" or "fire alarm"? Different projects categorized them differently. Your trade directories are a mess of inconsistent classifications that make it hard to find qualified subs when you need them.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Cleans Construction Data</h2>

        <p>We understand the specific challenges of construction data. Subcontractor relationships that span years and multiple projects. License and certification requirements. Trade classifications that need standardization.</p>

        <h3>Contractor deduplication</h3>
        <p>We match subcontractor and supplier records across company names, DBAs, license numbers, and contact patterns. We understand that construction companies often operate under multiple names. We consolidate duplicates while preserving complete project history and bid information.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> One golden record per contractor with complete history, plus a merge log showing what we combined.</p>

        <h3>Contact validation</h3>
        <p>We verify email addresses and phone numbers for project contacts, estimators, and company principals. Construction contacts often use personal cell phones or change roles frequently. We flag contacts who've moved and identify current information where possible.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> 93% deliverability guarantee on validated emails, with job change flags on stale contacts.</p>

        <h3>License and certification flagging</h3>
        <p>We flag contractor records with expired licenses, lapsed insurance, or outdated certifications based on available public records. This helps you maintain compliant vendor lists without manual verification of every contractor.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Compliance flags enabling quick identification of vendors needing credential updates.</p>

        <h3>Trade classification standardization</h3>
        <p>We normalize trade classifications to a consistent taxonomy. "Electrical contractor" and "electrician" and "electrical services" get mapped to standard categories so your trade directories actually work for finding qualified subs.</p>
        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Consistent trade codes enabling accurate vendor searches and bid invitations.</p>

        <h2>What Construction Teams Do With Clean Data</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Build bids faster.</strong> When you can quickly find qualified subs by trade and see their full project history, bid assembly gets easier.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain compliance.</strong> Clean license and insurance data means your approved vendor lists meet project requirements without last-minute scrambles.</li>
          <li><strong>Reach the right people.</strong> Current contact data means your bid invitations and project communications actually reach decision-makers.</li>
          <li><strong>See true contractor history.</strong> Consolidated records show each sub's complete project history with your company, enabling better vendor selection.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust your trade directories.</strong> Standardized classifications mean you find the right contractors when you need them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your data.</strong> Pull contractor, subcontractor, and project contact data from your construction management system or CRM. We work with exports from Procore, PlanGrid, Buildertrend, and standard spreadsheets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We assess it.</strong> We analyze your data for duplicates, stale contacts, inconsistent classifications, and credential issues. You get a report on what we find, even if you don't proceed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We clean it.</strong> Deduplication, validation, standardization. Human review on complex contractor matches. Most projects finish in 24-48 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You import clean data.</strong> Import-ready file with documentation of all changes. Your team starts working with accurate contractor data immediately.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you handle contractor and subcontractor duplicates?</h3>
          <p>We match contractor records across company names, license numbers, contact information, and trade classifications. Construction companies often have the same sub listed under different DBAs. We consolidate into single records while preserving project history.</p>

          <h3>Can you validate contractor licenses and certifications?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can verify contractor license status and flag expired credentials where public records are available. This helps you maintain compliant vendor lists.</p>

          <h3>Do you work with construction management software exports?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. We regularly clean data exported from Procore, PlanGrid, Buildertrend, CoConstruct, and other construction platforms. We understand the data structures.</p>

          <h3>How long does construction data cleaning take?</h3>
          <p>Most construction CRM cleaning projects complete in 24-48 hours for databases under 50,000 records. Larger datasets may take 3-5 business days.</p>

          <h3>Can you clean supplier and material vendor data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We clean both subcontractor databases and material supplier/vendor records. The same deduplication and validation processes apply to your supplier relationships.</p>
