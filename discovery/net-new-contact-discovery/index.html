        <h2>Your Target Accounts Are Missing People</h2>

        <p>You've identified your target accounts. Maybe 500 companies you want to sell to. But when you look in your CRM, most accounts have only one or two contacts. Some have none.</p>

        <p>One contact per account is a problem. If that person leaves, you've lost the relationship. If they're not the decision-maker, you're stuck. If they go dark, you have no alternative path.</p>

        <p>Net-new contact discovery fills these gaps. You give us your target account list and the roles you need. We find the contacts—verified, with email and phone—ready for outreach.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We had 200 target accounts with an average of 1.3 contacts each. After discovery, we had 4.2 contacts per account. Multi-threading actually became possible."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Account Executive</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>Account-Based Contact Discovery</h2>

        <p>This isn't list buying. You're not getting generic contacts at random companies. You're getting specific people at specific companies you've already identified as targets.</p>

        <p>You tell us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your target account list</li>
          <li>Roles you need (VP Sales, IT Director, CFO, etc.)</li>
          <li>Any contacts to exclude (already in CRM)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We find:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contacts matching those roles at those accounts</li>
          <li>Verified email addresses</li>
          <li>Direct phone numbers where available</li>
          <li>LinkedIn profiles for context</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Deliver</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Full name.</strong> First name, last name, properly formatted.</li>

          <li><strong>Current title.</strong> Verified as of discovery date. Titles change; we check.</li>

          <li><strong>Email address.</strong> Work email, validated for deliverability.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone number.</strong> Direct dial when available. Mobile numbers where appropriate.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn profile.</strong> URL for context and connection requests.</li>

          <li><strong>Seniority level.</strong> IC, Manager, Director, VP, C-level. For prioritization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Use Cases</h2>

        <p><strong>ABM campaign prep.</strong> Running an account-based campaign? You need contacts at every target account. We fill the gaps so everyone gets the campaign.</p>

        <p><strong>Multi-threading existing opportunities.</strong> You're working a deal but only know one person. We find the other stakeholders—legal, procurement, technical buyers.</p>

        <p><strong>Champion departures.</strong> Your champion left the company. We find who's in the role now, plus backup contacts.</p>

        <p><strong>Expansion into new buying centers.</strong> You sell to IT but want to sell to Finance. We find the Finance contacts at your existing accounts.</p>

        <h2>Coverage and Accuracy</h2>

        <p>Coverage depends on company type:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enterprise companies (1000+ employees):</strong> 80-95% coverage for common roles</li>
          <li><strong>Mid-market (100-1000 employees):</strong> 60-80% coverage</li>
          <li><strong>SMB (under 100 employees):</strong> 40-60% coverage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Email accuracy: 90%+ on delivered addresses. Phone accuracy: 80%+ on direct dials.</p>

        <p>We're transparent about what we can find. If a contact doesn't exist in sources, we don't make it up.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Net-new contact discovery is priced per contact found:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contact discovery:</strong> $2-5 per verified contact</li>
          <li><strong>Email verification included</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Phone research:</strong> Additional $1-2 per contact</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We quote based on your account list and target roles.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How is this different from ZoomInfo or Apollo?</h3>
          <p>Data platforms give you their existing database. We do custom research for your specific accounts. If the contact isn't in databases, we still try to find them.</p>

          <h3>What if you can't find contacts at an account?</h3>
          <p>You only pay for contacts we find. If an account has no discoverable contacts, there's no charge for that account.</p>

          <h3>Can you find specific people by name?</h3>
          <p>Yes, if you know who you're looking for. We can research specific individuals or research by role—your choice.</p>

          <h3>How current is the data?</h3>
          <p>We research at the time of your project. For ongoing needs, consider our <a href="/services/data-maintenance.html">Ongoing Maintenance</a> to keep contacts current.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Fill Your Account Gaps</h2>

        <p>Target accounts with one contact are single points of failure. Multi-threaded accounts close faster and churn less. We find the contacts you're missing.</p>
