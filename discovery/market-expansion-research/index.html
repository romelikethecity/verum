        <h2>Enter Markets With Confidence</h2>

        <p>You're expanding into a new geography. Or targeting a new vertical. Or launching a new product line. You need to know: How big is this market? Who are the prospects? What does the competitive landscape look like?</p>

        <p>Most companies enter new markets blind. They buy a list, make some calls, and figure it out as they go. Maybe they get lucky. Maybe they waste six months on the wrong approach.</p>

        <p>Market expansion research gives you the complete picture before you start. We map the entire market: every prospect, segmented by your criteria, validated and enriched. You know exactly what you're getting into.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"They mapped 8,500 prospects in the Pacific Northwest for our expansion. We hit our first-year targets in 7 months because we had the complete picture from day one."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— VP of Sales, Regional Expansion</cite>
        </div>

          <li><strong>Market sizing.</strong> TAM, SAM, SOM analysis. How big is the opportunity? How does it compare to your current markets?</li>

          <li><strong>Market segmentation.</strong> Break the market into segments by size, type, or other criteria. Prioritize where to focus.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitive landscape.</strong> Who else is selling to this market? What's their presence? Where are the gaps?</li>

          <li><strong>Key contacts.</strong> Decision-makers at target companies, enriched with contact information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Geographic Expansion</h2>

          <li>Territory alignment recommendations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You enter with a complete territory plan, not a generic list and guesswork.</p>

        <h2>Vertical Expansion</h2>

        <p>Moving into a new industry vertical? We research the sector:</p>

        <ul>

        <p><strong>Complete prospect file.</strong> Every business matching your criteria, validated and enriched. Ready to load into your CRM.</p>

        <p><strong>Market analysis report.</strong> Market size, segmentation, competitive landscape, and recommendations.</p>

        <p><strong>Segmentation framework.</strong> How to prioritize prospects. Which segments to attack first.</p>

        <p><strong>Key contacts.</strong> Decision-makers at priority accounts with contact information.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Market expansion research is priced based on scope:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Geographic scope (single metro vs. multi-state)</li>
          <li>Industry specificity (broad vs. niche)</li>
          <li>Depth of analysis required</li>
          <li>Contact enrichment needs</li>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How is this different from buying a list?</h3>
          <p>Lists are a starting point. Market expansion research is complete market mapping plus analysis. You get the list, but also understand the market structure, competition, and prioritization.</p>

          <h3>How long does research take?</h3>
          <p>Depends on scope. A single metro market map might take 1-2 weeks. A multi-region vertical expansion could take 4-6 weeks. We'll give you a timeline during scoping.</p>

          <h3>Can you research international markets?</h3>
          <p>Yes, though coverage varies by country. US, Canada, UK, and Western Europe have the best data availability. Other markets are possible but may have limitations.</p>

          <h3>What if I already have partial data?</h3>
          <p>Great. We can gap-fill around what you have. Send us your existing data and we'll identify what's missing.</p>
