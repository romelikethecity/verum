        <h2>Lists Built for You, Not Everyone</h2>

        <p>Generic lists are generic problems. You buy 10,000 "software companies," but half are the wrong size, a third are in the wrong location, and half of what's left doesn't match your ICP.</p>

        <p>Custom prospect list building is different. You define exactly what you want. Industry, size, geography, technology, role—your criteria, not generic categories. We build a list that matches your ICP, not someone's approximation of it.</p>

        <p>Every record is validated before delivery. Emails verified. Phones checked. Businesses confirmed as operating. No paying for garbage and hoping for the best.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We needed fintech companies in the Midwest with 50-200 employees using Salesforce. That's not a list you can just buy. They built exactly what we needed."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— SDR Manager</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>Define Your Criteria</h2>

        <p>We can filter on virtually any criteria. Common ones include:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Geography.</strong> Country, state, metro area, zip code, radius from a point. As specific as you need.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry.</strong> NAICS, SIC, or plain English descriptions. Broad categories or specific niches.</li>

          <li><strong>Company size.</strong> Employee count, revenue range, or both. Exclude too small or too big.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology usage.</strong> Companies using specific software, platforms, or tech stacks.</li>

          <li><strong>Business type.</strong> B2B vs B2C, private vs public, standalone vs franchise.</li>

          <li><strong>Role/Title.</strong> Specific contacts at these companies. VP Marketing, IT Director, Owner.</li>

          <li><strong>Exclusions.</strong> Companies you already work with, competitors, specific accounts to avoid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p>Every list includes:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Company information.</strong> Name, address, website, phone, industry classification.</li>

          <li><strong>Firmographic data.</strong> Employee count, revenue range, year founded, company type.</li>

          <li><strong>Validation status.</strong> Every email and phone verified before delivery.</li>

          <li><strong>Key contacts.</strong> Names, titles, verified email, direct phone where available.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn profiles.</strong> For contacts, enabling connection requests and research.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Define your criteria.</strong> We have a scoping conversation about exactly what you need. Industry, size, geography, roles, any special requirements.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We build the list.</strong> Using multiple data sources to find companies matching your criteria. Quality over quantity.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Validation pass.</strong> Every email verified, every phone checked, every business confirmed as operating.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enrichment pass.</strong> Fill in missing firmographic data, add contact information, standardize formats.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery.</strong> Clean file ready to load into your CRM, with documentation on what's included.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Prospect list building is priced based on complexity and volume:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simple criteria (industry + geography):</strong> $0.15-0.25 per record</li>
          <li><strong>Moderate criteria (+ size + contacts):</strong> $0.25-0.50 per record</li>
          <li><strong>Complex criteria (+ technology + exclusions):</strong> $0.50-1.00 per record</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Minimum project is $1,000. We quote after understanding your specific requirements.</p>
