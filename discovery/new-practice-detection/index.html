        <h2>New Practices Are Your Best Prospects</h2>

        <p>When a physician opens a new practice, they're making buying decisions. Equipment, supplies, EHR systems, billing services. They need vendors, and they haven't locked in relationships yet.</p>

        <p>But by the time a new practice shows up in commercial databases, it's been open for months. Every medical device rep in the territory has already called. The opportunity window has closed.</p>

        <p>New practice detection finds them earlier. We monitor the NPI Registry, medical board licenses, and Google Places continuously. You get the new practice list while they're still making decisions—while you still have first-mover advantage.</p>

          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"They found 2,400 new practices in Michigan alone. These were businesses that had opened in the last 18 months that we had no idea existed."</blockquote>

        <h2>How We Detect New Practices</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>NPI Registry monitoring.</strong> New NPIs registered, practice location changes, new group practice formations. Official federal data.</li>

          <li><strong>Medical board license tracking.</strong> New physician licenses, specialty certifications, practice authorizations. State-level data.</li>

          <li><strong>Google Places scanning.</strong> New medical practices create Google listings early. We scan major metros weekly.</li>

          <li><strong>Healthcare directory monitoring.</strong> Healthgrades, Vitals, WebMD profiles. New listings indicate new practices.</li>

          <li><strong>Insurance network updates.</strong> Practices added to insurance networks signal they're open for business.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Specialties We Cover</h2>

        <p>We detect new practices across all major medical specialties:</p>
