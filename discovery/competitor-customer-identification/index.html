        <h2>Know Your Competitor's Market</h2>

        <p>You know your own customers. But do you know your competitor's customers? Who are they selling to? How big is their install base in your target market? Where are the opportunities to win business away?</p>

        <p>Most companies guess. They assume competitors have roughly the same customer profile. They target the same lists and hope for the best.</p>

        <p>We don't guess. We identify specific companies using competitor products. Real names, real contact information, real opportunities. Not market estimates—actual prospect lists you can call tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"They identified 300 companies using our main competitor. We converted 15% within six months. That's business we wouldn't have known existed."</blockquote>

        <h2>How We Find Competitor Customers</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Technographic data.</strong> For software products, we detect which technologies companies use. Website scripts, job postings, API calls.</li>

          <li><strong>Public filings and records.</strong> RFPs, procurement notices, vendor registrations. Government and enterprise buyers leave public trails.</li>

          <li><strong>Job posting analysis.</strong> Companies hiring for specific skills often use specific products. Job requirements reveal technology stacks.</li>

          <li><strong>Review and directory mining.</strong> G2, Capterra, vendor directories. Customers leave reviews and appear in partner listings.</li>

          <li><strong>Case study and reference tracking.</strong> Competitors publish customer success stories. We collect and enrich these accounts.</li>

          <li><strong>Social signals.</strong> LinkedIn connections, Twitter mentions, event attendance. Digital breadcrumbs of vendor relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p>Every identified competitor customer is validated and enriched:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Company information.</strong> Name, address, website, industry, size.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitor product identified.</strong> Which competitor product they're using, and confidence level.</li>

          <li><strong>Source attribution.</strong> How we identified the relationship. Useful for conversation starters.</li>

          <li><strong>Key contacts.</strong> Decision-makers and users, with titles and contact info.</li>

          <li><strong>Firmographic enrichment.</strong> Revenue, employee count, industry details for targeting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>

        <p><strong>Win-back campaigns.</strong> Target competitor customers with displacement messaging. You know they're in-market for your category.</p>

        <p><strong>Contract timing.</strong> Enterprise contracts renew annually. Knowing who uses what helps you time outreach for renewal windows.</p>

        <p><strong>Market sizing.</strong> How big is your competitor's install base? Understand market share and opportunity size.</p>

        <p><strong>Competitive positioning.</strong> Which segments favor which competitors? Inform your positioning and messaging.</p>

        <p><strong>Sales battlecards.</strong> Arm your team with intelligence about specific accounts before calls.</p>

        <h2>Coverage Depends on Competitor Type</h2>

        <p>Some competitors are easier to identify than others:</p>

        <p><strong>Software products:</strong> Highest coverage. Technographic data, job postings, and reviews provide strong signals. Often 60-80% coverage.</p>

        <p><strong>SaaS platforms:</strong> Good coverage through web detection, integrations, and public listings. Usually 40-70% coverage.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional services:</strong> Moderate coverage through case studies, references, and RFP responses. Usually 20-40% coverage.</p>

        <p><strong>Physical products:</strong> Lower coverage unless there are public procurement records or industry directories. Coverage varies widely.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Competitor customer identification is priced per project based on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Number of competitors to research</li>
          <li>Target market size and geography</li>
          <li>Depth of enrichment required</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Typical projects range from $2,000 to $10,000. <a href="/#contact">Contact us</a> for a quote.</p>
