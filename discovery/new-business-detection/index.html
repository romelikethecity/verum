        <h2>The Early Bird Gets the Sale</h2>

        <p>New businesses are the best prospects. They're making decisions about vendors. Establishing relationships. Setting up systems. They need what you sell, and they haven't chosen a competitor yet.</p>

        <p>But by the time a new business appears in ZoomInfo or Apollo, it's 6-12 months old. Every sales rep in your industry has the same data. The prospect is already fielding calls from your competitors.</p>

        <p>New business detection finds them earlier. We scan Google Places, business registries, and permit databases continuously. You get the prospect list while the business is still new—while you still have first-mover advantage.</p>

        <h2>How We Detect New Businesses</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Google Places monitoring.</strong> New businesses create Google listings before anything else. We scan daily.</li>

          <li><strong>Business registry scanning.</strong> New incorporations, LLC filings, DBAs. Public records that signal new businesses.</li>

          <li><strong>Permit and license data.</strong> Building permits, occupancy certificates, professional licenses. Early indicators of new businesses opening.</li>

          <li><strong>Web presence detection.</strong> New domains, new company LinkedIn pages, new social profiles. Digital footprints of startups.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry-specific sources.</strong> NPI Registry for healthcare, SEC filings for finance. Sources specific to your vertical.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p>Every detected business is validated and enriched before delivery:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Business name and address.</strong> Verified against multiple sources.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone number.</strong> Validated as active and correctly associated with the business.</li>

          <li><strong>Website.</strong> When available, including domain age for freshness confirmation.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Categorized to match your targeting criteria.</li>

          <li><strong>Key contacts.</strong> Owner or manager names with LinkedIn profiles where available.</li>

          <li><strong>Detection date.</strong> When we first identified this business. Track freshness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>One-Time vs Ongoing</h2>

        <p><strong>One-time detection</strong> is a snapshot of new businesses in your market. Great for campaign planning, market entry, or annual territory refresh. We deliver all businesses opened in your timeframe.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing detection</strong> is continuous scanning. Weekly or monthly deliveries of new businesses as they appear. Never miss a new prospect. See our <a href="/services/data-maintenance.html">Ongoing Maintenance</a> service for details.</p>

        <h2>Who Uses This</h2>

        <p><strong>Field sales teams</strong> who want to be the first vendor a new business talks to.</p>

        <p><strong>Local service providers</strong> (insurance, banking, commercial services) competing for new business accounts.</p>

        <p><strong>Healthcare and medical device companies</strong> who need to know about new practices opening. See <a href="/discovery/new-practice-detection/">New Practice Detection</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>B2B companies</strong> selling to SMBs where new business formation is a key buying trigger.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>New business detection pricing depends on geography, industry specificity, and delivery frequency.</p>

        <p>One-time detection projects typically range from $1,000 to $3,000. Ongoing detection starts at $500/month.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How new are the businesses?</h3>
          <p>We catch businesses within 1-4 weeks of opening, depending on the source. Google Places is fastest. Business registries can lag a few weeks.</p>

          <h3>Can you filter by industry?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We detect based on your target criteria: industry, business type, geography. You don't get a firehose of everything—just prospects that match your ICP.</p>

          <h3>How do you avoid duplicates with my existing database?</h3>
          <p>We can compare detected businesses against your current database and only deliver net-new prospects.</p>

          <h3>What about businesses that open then close quickly?</h3>
          <p>It happens. We validate before delivery, but some new businesses fail. The upside of reaching good prospects early outweighs the occasional false start.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Get There First</h2>

        <p>Every new business is an opportunity. The question is whether you reach them before your competitors do. Detection gives you the head start.</p>
