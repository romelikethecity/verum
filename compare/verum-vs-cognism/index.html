        <h2>The Honest Comparison</h2>

        <p>Cognism has carved out a strong position in the B2B data market by focusing on what others do poorly: European data and mobile phone numbers. Their GDPR-compliant approach and "Diamond Data" verified phone numbers make them popular with teams selling into EMEA.</p>

        <p>But Cognism is fundamentally a prospecting platform. You search their database, build lists, and export contacts. They help you find new people to call.</p>

        <p>Verum solves a different problem: making your existing data accurate. We clean duplicates, validate contacts, and enrich missing fields. No prospecting platform, no list building—just better data.</p>

        <h2>When Cognism Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>You're selling into Europe.</strong> Cognism's EMEA data coverage is stronger than most US-focused competitors. Their GDPR compliance gives legal comfort.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone outreach is critical.</strong> Cognism's Diamond Data program human-verifies phone numbers. If cold calling is core to your sales motion, that matters.</li>

          <li><strong>You need to build prospect lists.</strong> Cognism's platform lets you search by industry, company size, job title, and more to build targeted lists.</li>

          <li><strong>You want intent data.</strong> Cognism offers intent signals to identify companies researching relevant topics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Verum Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Your existing data needs cleaning.</strong> Cognism adds new contacts; it doesn't fix duplicates and outdated records in your CRM. Verum does.</li>

          <li><strong>You don't need another prospecting platform.</strong> If you already have data sources, Verum makes them accurate without adding another tool.</li>

          <li><strong>Email is your primary channel.</strong> If phone outreach isn't central to your sales motion, Cognism's phone specialization matters less.</li>

          <li><strong>You want project-based work.</strong> Clean before a campaign, enrich before a push, maintain quarterly. No annual platform commitment.</li>

          <li><strong>You need deduplication.</strong> Verum specializes in finding and merging duplicate records. Cognism adds records without deduplicating against what you have.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The GDPR Question</h2>

        <p>Cognism markets heavily on GDPR compliance, and it's a legitimate strength for teams concerned about European privacy regulations. Their data sourcing and consent practices are designed with GDPR in mind.</p>

        <p>Verum handles data you provide, so GDPR compliance depends on how you collected that data originally. We process securely and delete after project completion, but we're not a source of new contact data.</p>

        <p>If GDPR-compliant prospecting is your priority, Cognism addresses that directly. If you're cleaning data you've already collected through compliant means, Verum helps without adding new compliance questions.</p>

        <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>

        <p>Cognism pricing (estimated):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Starting around $15,000-20,000/year</li>
          <li>Varies by seats, credits, and features</li>
          <li>Annual contracts standard</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Verum pricing (per project):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small data cleaning projects: $500-2,000</li>
          <li>Mid-sized enrichment projects: $2,000-5,000</li>
          <li>Large or complex projects: Custom pricing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For teams that need European prospecting tools year-round, Cognism's model makes sense. For teams that need periodic data cleaning, Verum's project approach is more cost-effective.</p>

        <h2>Can You Use Both?</h2>

        <p>Yes. They address different problems:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Use Cognism to build EMEA prospect lists and get verified phone numbers</li>
          <li>Use Verum to clean your overall CRM, deduplicate Cognism imports alongside other sources, and validate existing contacts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Cognism helps you find new European contacts. Verum helps you keep your entire database—including Cognism data—clean and accurate.</p>
