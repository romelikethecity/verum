      <h2>When Cognism Makes Sense</h2>

      <p>Cognism is a strong choice if you're prospecting into European markets. Their database was built EMEA-first, and it shows. For companies selling across the UK, Germany, France, and the Nordics, Cognism's contact coverage in those regions is among the best in the industry. If most of your target accounts are in Europe, Cognism's data has real depth there.</p>

      <p>The GDPR compliance story is a genuine differentiator. Cognism's "Diamond Data" (phone-verified mobile numbers) and their Do Not Call list integration make them a solid option for teams where compliance isn't optional. If your legal team is heavily involved in outreach approval and GDPR is a primary concern, Cognism has built real infrastructure around that.</p>

      <p>It also makes sense for enterprise sales teams with the budget and headcount to use a self-serve platform effectively. Cognism is a tool, not a service. Someone needs to learn the interface, build searches, manage exports, and maintain the CRM integration. If you have a dedicated sales ops or RevOps person handling that, Cognism can deliver good results in EMEA markets.</p>

      <h2>When Verum Is the Better Choice</h2>

      <p>If your market is the United States or North America, Verum is the clear winner. Cognism's US data is weaker than its EMEA coverage, and that's widely acknowledged. Verum's pipeline is built for US businesses: healthcare providers, local and regional companies, SMB owners, and mid-market firms that European-first databases tend to cover poorly.</p>

      <p>Verum is better when you need data cleaning, not just new contacts. Cognism is a prospecting database. It doesn't deduplicate your CRM, fix inconsistent formatting, validate existing email addresses, or standardize company names. If your data quality problem is that your existing records are a mess, Cognism won't help with that. Verum starts with cleaning.</p>

      <p>No annual contract is a significant advantage for teams that don't want to commit $15K+ before seeing results. Verum's per-record model means you can start with a small project, evaluate the results, and scale from there. No year-long commitment. No "use it or lose it" pressure.</p>

      <p>And Verum handles the work for you. If you don't have a dedicated RevOps person to manage a platform like Cognism, the subscription can go underused. Verum's done-for-you model means you get results without adding platform management to anyone's plate.</p>

      <h2>Key Differences</h2>

      <p><strong>Geography matters more than you think.</strong> This is the single biggest differentiator between Verum and Cognism. Cognism was built for EMEA and later expanded to the US. Verum was built for US markets. If you're selling domestically or across North America, Verum's data pipeline covers the types of businesses and contacts that EMEA-first databases struggle with: single-location healthcare practices, regional service companies, local business owners who don't show up in global databases.</p>

      <p><strong>Annual contracts vs. project-based pricing.</strong> Cognism's custom pricing typically starts at $15K/yr and scales up from there. That's a significant commitment before you've seen any results. Verum charges per record, per project. You can start with a pilot of a few thousand records, evaluate the output, and decide whether to continue. The risk profile is fundamentally different.</p>

      <p><strong>Platform vs. service.</strong> Like other tools in this category, Cognism gives you access to a platform. You search, you filter, you export. Verum takes data from you and returns it cleaned and enriched. For teams that are already managing Salesforce, a marketing automation platform, and a dozen other tools, adding another platform to the stack versus handing data work to a service is a real consideration.</p>

      <p><strong>Data cleaning is the gap no prospecting tool fills.</strong> Cognism, like ZoomInfo, Apollo, and Lusha, is built to help you find new contacts. None of these platforms clean your existing data. If you have 30,000 CRM records with 20% duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and outdated titles, buying a prospecting subscription doesn't fix that. It adds more records to an already broken database. Verum's cleaning and enrichment pipeline addresses the root problem.</p>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <h3>I sell into both US and European markets. Should I use both Verum and Cognism?</h3>
      <p>That can work well. Use Cognism for EMEA prospecting where their database is strongest, and Verum for US data cleaning and enrichment where our pipeline outperforms. Verum can also clean and enrich Cognism exports before you import them to your CRM, ensuring consistency across regions.</p>

      <h3>How does Verum's pricing compare to Cognism's $15K+/yr?</h3>
      <p>Verum charges per record with no minimum commitment. A typical project of 10,000 records costs significantly less than Cognism's annual contract, and that includes full data cleaning that Cognism doesn't offer. For teams doing quarterly or one-time data projects, the savings are substantial. For teams that need ongoing daily access to a prospecting database, the comparison is less direct because they solve different problems.</p>

      <h3>Does Verum work with European data?</h3>
      <p>Verum's primary strength is US and North American data. We can enrich European records from our data sources, but Cognism's EMEA database has deeper coverage of European contacts. If your primary market is Europe, Cognism is likely the better tool for prospecting. If your primary market is the US and you have some European records that need cleaning, Verum can handle both.</p>

      <h3>What about Cognism's phone-verified mobile numbers?</h3>
      <p>Cognism's Diamond Data (manually verified mobile numbers) is a genuine feature if direct dials to specific contacts are critical for your outreach. Verum verifies phone numbers through our enrichment pipeline, but we don't do manual phone verification for every record. For bulk data cleaning and enrichment projects, our verification approach is more practical. For a small number of high-value contacts where a verified mobile number is essential, Cognism's Diamond Data has value.</p>
