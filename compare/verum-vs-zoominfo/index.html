      <p><strong>Verum vs ZoomInfo</strong> — ZoomInfo is a self-serve B2B database platform with 260M+ contact records where your team does the searching, filtering, and exporting. Verum is a done-for-you data service where we handle cleaning, enrichment, and owner identification. They solve different problems in fundamentally different ways. Here's how they compare.</p>

      <h2>When ZoomInfo Makes Sense</h2>

      <p>ZoomInfo is a strong choice for large enterprise sales teams with dedicated data ops people. If you have a team of 50+ SDRs running outbound at scale, a RevOps team managing your tech stack full-time, and the budget for a $15K-$50K+ annual contract, ZoomInfo's massive database and intent signals can be worth the investment.</p>

      <p>It also makes sense if your primary need is net-new prospecting. ZoomInfo's 260M+ contact database is built for teams that need to find people they don't already know about. If you're starting from scratch and need to build a prospect list in a specific market segment, that's ZoomInfo's wheelhouse.</p>

      <p>And if your team has the bandwidth to actually use the platform. ZoomInfo is a tool, not a service. Someone on your team needs to learn it, maintain search filters, export data, and manage the integration with your CRM. If you have that person (and they aren't already drowning in other work), ZoomInfo can deliver real value.</p>

      <h2>When Verum Is the Better Choice</h2>

      <p>Verum wins when your problem isn't "we need more data." It's "the data we already have is a mess."</p>

      <p>If your CRM has thousands of contacts with outdated titles, missing phone numbers, duplicate records, and no standardization, ZoomInfo won't fix that. You'll just be adding fresh contacts on top of a broken foundation. Verum cleans what you have, fills in what's missing, and identifies business owners your team couldn't find on their own.</p>

      <p>Verum is the better fit if you're a mid-market team without dedicated data ops staff. You don't have someone whose full-time job is managing a ZoomInfo instance. You need to hand off a messy spreadsheet or CRM export and get back clean, enriched data without learning another platform.</p>

      <p>It's also better if you sell into healthcare, local businesses, or SMB markets. ZoomInfo's database skews enterprise and tech. If you're trying to find the owner of a dental practice in Tulsa or the decision-maker at a regional insurance agency, Verum's verification pipeline is built for exactly that.</p>

      <p>And if you care about per-record pricing over annual commitments. With Verum, you pay for what you use. No $15K minimum. No annual lock-in. No "use it or lose it" credit system.</p>

      <h2>Key Differences</h2>

      <p><strong>Different problems, different solutions.</strong> ZoomInfo is a prospecting database. Verum is a data service. ZoomInfo helps you find new people to sell to. Verum takes data you already have and makes it accurate, complete, and usable. Most companies actually need both prospecting and data hygiene, but they're separate problems that require separate approaches.</p>

      <p><strong>Who does the work matters.</strong> ZoomInfo gives your team a powerful tool and says "go." Verum takes the work off your plate entirely. For teams that are already stretched thin, the difference between "here's a platform with training videos" and "send us your file, we'll handle it" is the difference between a project that gets done and one that sits on someone's to-do list for six months.</p>

      <p><strong>Data cleaning isn't optional.</strong> Enrichment on top of dirty data just creates more mess. If you have 30,000 contacts and 15% are duplicates, 20% have wrong titles, and 10% have invalid emails, adding ZoomInfo data to that pile doesn't fix the underlying problem. It makes it worse. Verum starts with cleaning because enrichment without clean data is wasted money.</p>

      <p><strong>The pricing math is different than you think.</strong> ZoomInfo's $15K/yr starting price assumes you'll use it enough to justify the cost. For teams that need one-time or quarterly data projects, that math doesn't work. Verum's per-record model means you're paying for outcomes, not access to a platform you might underuse.</p>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <h3>Can I use Verum and ZoomInfo together?</h3>
      <p>Yes, and some of our clients do exactly that. They use ZoomInfo for net-new prospecting and Verum to clean and enrich their existing CRM data. The two services solve different problems, so they complement each other well. We can also clean and deduplicate ZoomInfo exports before they go into your CRM.</p>

      <h3>Is Verum cheaper than ZoomInfo?</h3>
      <p>For most mid-market teams, yes. ZoomInfo starts at $15K/yr with annual contracts, and that price goes up significantly with additional seats and features. Verum charges per record with no annual commitment, so you're paying for actual data work, not platform access. For a one-time project of 10,000 records, the cost difference is substantial.</p>

      <h3>Does Verum have a contact database like ZoomInfo?</h3>
      <p>Verum doesn't sell access to a static database. Instead, we pull from 50+ data sources in real time to verify, clean, and enrich your specific records. The difference: ZoomInfo gives you a snapshot from their database. Verum gives you verified, current data sourced and cross-checked at the time of your project.</p>

      <h3>What if I need to cancel ZoomInfo but keep the data?</h3>
      <p>ZoomInfo's terms typically require you to delete exported data when your contract ends. With Verum, every record we deliver is yours permanently. No deletion clauses, no re-licensing fees. You pay once for the data work, and the results belong to you.</p>
