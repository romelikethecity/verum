        <h2>The Honest Comparison</h2>

        <p>ZoomInfo is a powerful platform. They have the largest B2B database, sophisticated intent signals, and comprehensive sales engagement tools. If you need a self-serve platform for constant prospecting, they're the market leader for a reason.</p>

        <p>But ZoomInfo's model isn't right for everyone. Annual contracts starting at $15K+ require commitment before you know if it works. You need someone to learn and manage the platform. And having access to millions of records doesn't help if your existing CRM is full of duplicates and outdated data.</p>

        <p>Verum takes a different approach: we do the data work for you.</p>

        <h2>When ZoomInfo Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Large sales teams doing constant prospecting.</strong> If you have multiple SDRs building lists daily, ZoomInfo's unlimited access model works.</li>

          <li><strong>You need intent data.</strong> ZoomInfo's intent signals and buyer behavior tracking are features Verum doesn't offer.</li>

          <li><strong>You want an all-in-one platform.</strong> ZoomInfo combines data, engagement, and conversation intelligence in one place.</li>

          <li><strong>Budget isn't a constraint.</strong> If $15K-50K+ annually is manageable, ZoomInfo delivers comprehensive features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Verum Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Your existing data is a mess.</strong> ZoomInfo adds new data; it doesn't fix what you have. Verum cleans your CRM first, then enriches it.</li>

          <li><strong>You don't need another platform.</strong> Verum delivers clean data back to your existing systems. No new tool to learn or manage.</li>

          <li><strong>You want project-based pricing.</strong> Clean your data before a campaign, enrich before a push, or run quarterly maintenance—pay only for what you need.</li>

          <li><strong>You value human verification.</strong> Every Verum project includes human review for judgment calls that automation gets wrong.</li>

          <li><strong>You can't commit to annual contracts.</strong> Verum has no minimums, no annual commitments, and no long-term lock-in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Data Quality Difference</h2>

        <p>ZoomInfo has impressive database size—over 100 million business profiles. But size and accuracy aren't the same thing. Studies suggest that even premium B2B databases have 20-30% data decay annually.</p>

        <p>More importantly, ZoomInfo gives you access to data. Verum actually cleans and enriches your specific data. The difference matters:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>ZoomInfo approach:</strong> Search their database, export contacts, import to your CRM. Now you have new records alongside your existing duplicates and outdated data.</li>

          <li><strong>Verum approach:</strong> Export your CRM, we deduplicate and validate everything, enrich with missing fields, return clean data. Your entire database is better, not just bigger.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pricing Reality</h2>

        <p>ZoomInfo doesn't publish pricing, but market rates for their Sales tier typically start around $15,000/year for limited seats and credits. Professional and Advanced tiers with intent data and more features run $30,000-50,000+/year.</p>

        <p>Verum pricing scales with project scope:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small data cleaning projects: $500-2,000</li>
          <li>Mid-sized enrichment projects: $2,000-5,000</li>
          <li>Large or complex projects: Custom pricing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For many teams, a one-time Verum project costs less than one month of ZoomInfo—and delivers cleaner data for the long term.</p>

        <h2>Can You Use Both?</h2>

        <p>Absolutely. Many companies use ZoomInfo for prospecting and Verum for data hygiene. The combination works well:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Use ZoomInfo to build prospect lists and track intent signals</li>
          <li>Use Verum quarterly to clean your CRM, deduplicate ZoomInfo imports, and validate existing records</li>
        </ul>

        <p>ZoomInfo adds data. Verum makes sure all your data—from every source—is accurate and usable.</p>
