        <h2>The Honest Comparison</h2>

        <p>Clearbit built their reputation on elegant APIs and real-time enrichment. When someone fills out a form with just an email, Clearbit can instantly append company data, job title, and firmographics. For product-led growth companies optimizing conversion flows, that's powerful.</p>

        <p>But Clearbit's API-first approach requires technical resources. You need developers to implement it, someone to manage the integration, and ongoing monitoring of API usage and costs. For many teams, that's overhead they don't need.</p>

        <p>Verum works differently: export your data, we clean and enrich it, you get clean data back. No APIs, no integration, no technical resources required.</p>

        <h2>Key Differences</h2>

        <h2>When Clearbit Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>You need real-time enrichment.</strong> If enriching form submissions instantly is critical for your conversion flow, Clearbit's APIs deliver that.</li>

          <li><strong>You have technical resources.</strong> Clearbit's power comes from its APIs. If you have developers to implement and maintain integrations, you can unlock that power.</li>

          <li><strong>You're a HubSpot customer.</strong> Since Clearbit's acquisition by HubSpot, integration is tighter for HubSpot users.</li>

          <li><strong>You need website visitor identification.</strong> Clearbit Reveal identifies anonymous website visitors. Verum doesn't offer this.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Verum Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>You don't have dev resources.</strong> Verum requires zero technical implementation. Export your data, we handle everything.</li>

          <li><strong>Your existing data needs cleaning.</strong> Clearbit enriches data; it doesn't deduplicate or clean what you have. Verum does both.</li>

          <li><strong>You want project-based work.</strong> Clean before a campaign, enrich before a sales push, maintain quarterly. No ongoing API costs.</li>

          <li><strong>You value human verification.</strong> Every Verum project includes human review for edge cases and judgment calls.</li>

          <li><strong>Real-time isn't required.</strong> If 24-48 hour turnaround works, Verum's batch approach is simpler and often cheaper.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Technical Overhead Question</h2>

        <p>Clearbit's APIs are well-documented and developer-friendly. But "developer-friendly" still means you need developers. Implementation typically involves:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>API integration into your forms or backend</li>
          <li>Mapping Clearbit fields to your CRM/database</li>
          <li>Handling API responses and errors</li>
          <li>Managing rate limits and usage</li>
          <li>Monitoring costs as volume scales</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Verum's approach:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Export your data (CSV, Excel, or database export)</li>
          <li>We clean, enrich, and return it</li>
          <li>Import back to your system</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For teams without dedicated technical resources—or teams that want to spend those resources on product rather than data plumbing—Verum's approach is simpler.</p>

        <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>

        <p>Clearbit pricing varies by product and volume:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enrichment API: Usage-based pricing</li>
          <li>Reveal (visitor identification): Starts around $12,000/year</li>
          <li>Integrated with HubSpot: Included in some plans</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Verum pricing (per project):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small data cleaning projects: $500-2,000</li>
          <li>Mid-sized enrichment projects: $2,000-5,000</li>
          <li>Large or complex projects: Custom pricing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For batch enrichment of existing data, Verum is typically more cost-effective. For real-time enrichment at scale, Clearbit's per-record pricing can be competitive.</p>

        <h2>Can You Use Both?</h2>

        <p>Yes. They solve different problems:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Use Clearbit for real-time form enrichment and website visitor identification</li>
          <li>Use Verum for periodic cleaning and batch enrichment of your existing database</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Clearbit handles incoming data in real-time. Verum handles your existing database in batches. The combination covers both needs.</p>
