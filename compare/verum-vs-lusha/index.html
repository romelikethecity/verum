        <p class="page-hero__subtitle">Lusha popularized the browser extension approach to contact data—see a LinkedIn profile, click a button, get contact info. Verum works differently: we clean and enrich your entire database. Here's how to choose.</p>

        <h2>The Honest Comparison</h2>

        <p>Lusha made contact data simple: install a browser extension, browse LinkedIn or company websites, click to reveal email addresses and phone numbers. For individual prospectors who need quick access to contact details, it's convenient and affordable.</p>

        <p>But Lusha is designed for one-at-a-time lookups. You find a person, get their contact info, move on. It doesn't help when you have thousands of existing records that need cleaning or enrichment.</p>

        <p>Verum works at the database level. Export your CRM, we process everything—deduplicating, validating, enriching—and return clean data. Different scale, different approach.</p>

        <h2>When Lusha Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>You need quick, one-off lookups.</strong> Browsing LinkedIn and need an email? Lusha's extension makes it instant.</li>

          <li><strong>You're an individual contributor.</strong> For solo SDRs or small teams doing manual prospecting, Lusha's per-credit model works.</li>

          <li><strong>You want a free starting point.</strong> Lusha's free tier (5 credits/month) lets you try before committing.</li>

          <li><strong>You need phone numbers.</strong> Lusha includes direct dials and mobile numbers in their credits, which some competitors charge extra for.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Verum Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>You have thousands of records to process.</strong> Lusha's credit model gets expensive at scale. Verum's project pricing is more economical for bulk work.</li>

          <li><strong>Your database needs cleaning.</strong> Lusha adds contact info; it doesn't deduplicate or fix existing data. Verum does both.</li>

          <li><strong>You want someone else to do the work.</strong> Lusha requires you to look up each contact. Verum processes your entire database while you focus on selling.</li>

          <li><strong>You need validation, not just enrichment.</strong> Verum validates existing contacts—checking if they've moved, emails still work, companies still exist. Lusha doesn't validate your current data.</li>

          <li><strong>You don't want another tool to manage.</strong> Verum delivers clean data back to your existing systems. No browser extension, no platform to learn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Scale Question</h2>

        <p>Lusha pricing makes sense for low-volume lookups:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Free: 5 credits/month</li>
          <li>Pro: $36/user/month (480 credits/year)</li>
          <li>Premium: $59/user/month (960 credits/year)</li>
          <li>Scale: Custom pricing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At $36/month for 40 credits, you're paying roughly $0.90 per contact. That's reasonable for occasional lookups.</p>

        <p>But if you need to enrich 5,000 records, that's $4,500 in Lusha credits—plus the time to look up each one manually. A Verum project handling 5,000 records might cost $2,000-3,000 and be done in 24-48 hours with no manual work on your end.</p>

        <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>

        <p>Lusha pricing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Free: 5 credits/month</li>
          <li>Pro: $36/user/month</li>
          <li>Premium: $59/user/month</li>
          <li>Scale: Custom</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Verum pricing (per project):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small data cleaning projects: $500-2,000</li>
          <li>Mid-sized enrichment projects: $2,000-5,000</li>
          <li>Large or complex projects: Custom pricing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For 50-100 lookups per month, Lusha is probably cheaper. For thousands of records, Verum's project model is more cost-effective.</p>

        <h2>Can You Use Both?</h2>

        <p>Yes. They serve different purposes:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Use Lusha for quick lookups when you find interesting prospects on LinkedIn</li>
          <li>Use Verum quarterly to clean your entire CRM, including records from Lusha and other sources</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Lusha helps you add new contacts one at a time. Verum helps you keep your entire database—including Lusha data—accurate and deduplicated.</p>
