      <p><strong>Verum vs Lusha</strong> — Lusha is a Chrome extension and B2B contact database designed for individual reps who need direct dials and email addresses quickly. Verum is a done-for-you data service that handles bulk cleaning, enrichment, and owner identification. One is a point tool for reps. The other is a data service for teams. Here's how they compare.</p>

      <h2>When Lusha Makes Sense</h2>

      <p>Lusha is a good fit for individual sales reps who need to find a phone number or email address right now. You're on someone's LinkedIn profile, you need their direct dial, and Lusha's Chrome extension surfaces it in seconds. For that specific workflow, it's fast and effective.</p>

      <p>It also works well for small sales teams doing targeted outreach. If you're calling 20 prospects a day and just need contact details for each one, Lusha's credit-based system keeps costs low. A single rep might only use 20-30 credits per day, which stays within the cheaper plans.</p>

      <p>Lusha's GDPR compliance features are worth noting too. The platform takes data privacy seriously with opt-out mechanisms and consent management, which matters if you're reaching out to European contacts. If compliance is a primary concern for your outreach, Lusha has invested in those safeguards.</p>

      <h2>When Verum Is the Better Choice</h2>

      <p>Verum wins the moment you need to work with data at scale. Lusha is designed for one-at-a-time lookups. If you need to clean and enrich 5,000 contacts, or 50,000, doing that through a Chrome extension credit by credit isn't realistic. Verum processes bulk data as a standard service, and the economics are completely different at volume.</p>

      <p>The per-seat pricing gap gets wide fast. Lusha charges per user per month, plus credits. If you have 10 reps, you're paying for 10 seats. With Verum, there are no seat fees. You pay per record regardless of how many people on your team use the resulting data. For growing teams, this is a significant cost difference.</p>

      <p>Verum is the better choice when your data needs go beyond "find this person's phone number." Lusha focuses on direct dials and email addresses. It doesn't clean your existing CRM data, identify business owners, or provide the deep enrichment (company data, technology stacks, firmographic details) that comes from pulling across 50+ sources. If your data problem is bigger than contact lookup, you need a service, not an extension.</p>

      <p>And Verum is built for the markets Lusha's database covers poorly. If you sell to healthcare providers, local businesses, or SMB owners, Lusha's database may not have the contacts you need. These aren't the enterprise tech contacts that populate most B2B databases. Verum's verification pipeline is specifically designed to find and verify decision-makers in these harder-to-reach segments.</p>

      <h2>Key Differences</h2>

      <p><strong>Point tool vs. full service.</strong> Lusha solves a narrow problem very well: surfacing contact information for a person you've already identified. Verum solves the broader data challenge: cleaning what you have, finding what's missing, verifying what you've found, and enriching records with complete data from multiple sources. They're different scopes of work entirely.</p>

      <p><strong>Credits burn faster than you expect.</strong> Lusha's pricing looks affordable at the plan level, but credits get consumed quickly. Every phone number lookup, every email reveal, every contact export burns credits. Teams that start on a basic plan often find themselves upgrading within a few months or rationing credits toward the end of billing cycles. Verum's per-record pricing is predictable: you know the cost before the work starts.</p>

      <p><strong>No data cleaning in the equation.</strong> Lusha appends contact information to records. If those records are duplicated, misspelled, or inconsistently formatted, Lusha doesn't care. Verum starts with cleaning because adding a phone number to a duplicate record doesn't make the duplicate go away. It just means you now have two records with phone numbers instead of one.</p>

      <p><strong>Built for reps vs. built for teams.</strong> Lusha's Chrome extension is optimized for individual rep workflow: browse LinkedIn, click to reveal, save to CRM. Verum is optimized for team-level data operations: send a dataset, get back clean enriched records that everyone can use. The right choice depends on whether your data challenge is one rep at a time or an entire database.</p>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <h3>Lusha costs $29/mo. How does Verum compete on price?</h3>
      <p>That $29/mo is per user and comes with limited credits. A team of 8 reps on Lusha's Professional plan runs over $1,500/month, and they'll likely need additional credits. Verum charges per record with no seat fees. For a one-time project of 10,000 records, Verum is typically less expensive than a few months of Lusha for an equivalent team, and you get data cleaning and full enrichment included.</p>

      <h3>Can I use Lusha's Chrome extension and Verum together?</h3>
      <p>You can, and some teams do. Reps use Lusha for on-the-fly lookups during their daily workflow while Verum handles larger data projects like CRM cleanups, list enrichment, or quarterly data refreshes. Lusha fills the "I need this one number right now" gap. Verum fills the "our database is a mess and we need it fixed" gap.</p>

      <h3>What about Lusha's bulk enrichment features?</h3>
      <p>Lusha has added bulk capabilities to their platform, but it still runs on their credit system. Enriching 5,000 contacts in bulk through Lusha burns 5,000 credits, which can exceed your monthly allocation quickly. The credits also don't include data cleaning, deduplication, or verification. Verum's bulk processing includes all of that, and pricing is set before work begins, so there are no surprises.</p>

      <h3>Does Verum provide direct dial phone numbers like Lusha?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Verum's enrichment pipeline includes phone number verification and direct dial sourcing from 50+ data providers. The difference is that Verum delivers verified phone numbers as part of a full enrichment project, not as individual credit-based lookups. For bulk needs, this approach is more cost-effective and includes quality verification that standalone lookups don't provide.</p>
