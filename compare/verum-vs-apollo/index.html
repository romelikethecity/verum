        <h2>The Honest Comparison</h2>

        <p>Apollo.io has become one of the most popular sales intelligence platforms, especially for startups and SMBs. Their free tier and affordable paid plans make prospecting accessible to teams that can't afford ZoomInfo pricing. Add in email sequencing and engagement tracking, and you have an all-in-one outbound tool.</p>

        <p>But Apollo solves a different problem than Verum. Apollo helps you find new prospects and reach out to them. Verum helps you clean and improve the data you already have.</p>

        <p>If you're asking "How do I find more leads?", Apollo is a solid choice. If you're asking "How do I fix my messy CRM?", you need Verum.</p>

        <h2>When Apollo Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>You need prospecting and outreach in one tool.</strong> Apollo's email sequences and dialer mean you can find contacts and reach them without switching platforms.</li>

          <li><strong>Budget is tight.</strong> Apollo's free tier is genuinely useful, and paid plans are fraction of ZoomInfo's cost.</li>

          <li><strong>You want to build lists from scratch.</strong> Apollo's search filters let you build targeted prospect lists based on industry, company size, titles, and more.</li>

          <li><strong>Your team does high-volume outbound.</strong> Apollo's unlimited email sending and sequence features support aggressive outreach campaigns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Verum Makes Sense</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Your CRM is full of duplicates.</strong> Apollo adds new data; it doesn't fix your existing mess. Verum deduplicates and merges records across your entire database.</li>

          <li><strong>You need to validate existing contacts.</strong> Apollo can't tell you which of your current contacts have left their companies. Verum validates and flags stale records.</li>

          <li><strong>You want enrichment without a platform.</strong> Verum enriches your data and returns it to your existing systems. No new tool to learn.</li>

          <li><strong>You value human verification.</strong> Verum combines AI with human review for judgment calls. Apollo is fully automated.</li>

          <li><strong>You don't need outreach features.</strong> If you already have a sales engagement tool, Apollo's outreach features are redundant. Verum focuses purely on data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Data Quality Question</h2>

        <p>Apollo has over 250 million contacts in their database. That's impressive breadth. But breadth and accuracy aren't the same thing.</p>

        <p>Apollo's data comes from web scraping, crowdsourcing, and aggregation. This approach scales well but can have accuracy issues. You might find that 20-30% of emails bounce or contacts have moved on.</p>

        <p>Verum takes a different approach: we validate your specific data against 50+ sources and include human review. We're not trying to build the biggest database—we're trying to make your database accurate.</p>

        <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>

        <p>Apollo pricing (per user/month):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Free: 600 email credits/year</li>
          <li>Basic: $49/month (5,000 credits)</li>
          <li>Professional: $99/month (unlimited)</li>
          <li>Organization: $119/month (unlimited + advanced features)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Verum pricing (per project):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small data cleaning projects: $500-2,000</li>
          <li>Mid-sized enrichment projects: $2,000-5,000</li>
          <li>Large or complex projects: Custom pricing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a 5-person sales team, Apollo costs $495-595/month. One Verum cleaning project might cost $1,500-3,000 and last you 6-12 months. Different models for different needs.</p>

        <h2>Can You Use Both?</h2>

        <p>Yes, and many teams do. The combination works well:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Use Apollo for prospecting and building target account lists</li>
          <li>Use Apollo's outreach features to run email sequences</li>
          <li>Use Verum quarterly to clean your CRM, deduplicate Apollo imports, and validate your entire database</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Apollo is great at finding new contacts. Verum is great at making sure all your data—from Apollo and everywhere else—is accurate and usable.</p>
