        <h2>The Taxonomy Problem</h2>

        <p>You want to run a campaign targeting financial services companies. Simple enough. You filter your database by industry. And you get results like: "Financial," "Finance," "Banking," "FinServ," "BFSI," "Financial Services," and "Other." Same industry, seventeen different labels. Your filter catches some, misses others.</p>

        <p>This happens because industry data comes from everywhere. Some came from form submissions where prospects typed whatever they wanted. Some came from data vendors with different taxonomies. Some was entered by reps who picked from a dropdown with 200 options and chose the first thing that seemed close.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had 50,000 accounts with industry data in chaos. When they needed to identify managed service providers in their database, they couldn't. The MSPs were scattered across "IT Services," "Technology Consulting," "Computer Services," "Partner," and a dozen other categories. After we standardized everything to NAICS codes, 703 MSPs emerged from the mess. An $875K revenue opportunity that had been invisible.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>NAICS codes.</strong> The current US standard for industry classification. 6-digit codes with hierarchical structure from broad sector to specific subsector.</li>

          <li><strong>SIC codes.</strong> The older standard still widely used for regulatory and financial reporting. We can provide both NAICS and SIC for maximum compatibility.</li>

          <li><strong>Custom taxonomy mapping.</strong> If you have your own industry categories, we can map to them. Your "Manufacturing" might include subcategories specific to your business.</li>

          <li><strong>Primary and secondary industries.</strong> Many companies operate across industries. We identify the primary (where most revenue comes from) and relevant secondary classifications.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry descriptions.</strong> Human-readable descriptions alongside the codes. "NAICS 541511" means nothing to most people. "Custom Computer Programming Services" does.</li>

          <li><strong>Standardization of existing data.</strong> If you have messy industry data already, we'll clean and map it to consistent codes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names, domains, and whatever industry data you currently have (even if it's messy).</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We classify each company.</strong> Analyzing company descriptions, products, services, and revenue sources to determine primary industry.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Companies in emerging industries or those spanning multiple sectors get manual review. AI handles scale, humans handle judgment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Standardized data delivered.</strong> Each company with NAICS code, SIC code (if requested), and human-readable description. Your database becomes filterable.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Industry classification runs $0.03-0.08 per company, depending on volume and whether you need basic NAICS codes or full multi-taxonomy mapping with primary and secondary industries.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What classification systems do you support?</h3>
          <p>NAICS, SIC, and custom taxonomies. We can provide multiple systems simultaneously if you need compatibility with different tools or reports.</p>

          <h3>How do you classify companies that span multiple industries?</h3>
          <p>We identify the primary industry and can provide secondary classifications. A software company that also sells hardware gets both categories noted.</p>

          <h3>What's your accuracy rate?</h3>
          <p>95-98% on primary industry classification. Edge cases and emerging industries get human review.</p>

          <h3>Can you standardize our existing messy industry data?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Whatever you have now, however inconsistent, we can clean and map to a single consistent taxonomy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Fix Your Industry Data?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see the mess?</strong> Send us a sample. We'll show you how many distinct industry values you have and how they should map to standard codes.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to standardize?</strong> Send us your full company list. We'll return consistent industry classifications that actually work for segmentation.</p>
