        <h2>The B2B Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Your database has grown over years. Trade shows, webinars, content downloads, manual entry. Thousands of records, maybe tens of thousands. But the data quality varies wildly.</p>

        <p>Some records have everything. Name, title, email, phone, company, industry, size. Others have a name and email from 2019. Industry is blank for a third of accounts. Company size is whatever someone self-reported on a form. Job titles range from standardized to creative interpretations.</p>

        <p>So your targeting is incomplete. Your scoring models run on partial data. Your reps waste time researching instead of selling. Your campaigns reach the wrong people because you can't segment accurately.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had 50,000 accounts accumulated over 17 years. The data had been touched by five different vendors. Industry classifications were missing for thousands of records. Employee counts were blank for nearly 10% of the database. They couldn't tell MSPs from end customers from distributors.</p>

        <h3>What we delivered</h3>

        <p>98.6% industry classification coverage after enrichment. 91.8% employee count coverage. 108% increase in total data points per account. We found 703 MSP accounts buried in generic "Partner" categories. We caught 195 job changes before their reps wasted outreach on people who'd left.</p>

        <p>The ROI was immediate. If the average MSP deal is $25K annually and they convert just 5% of those newly-discovered MSPs, that's $875,000 in new ARR from accounts already in their CRM.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <h3>Contact Data</h3>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified email addresses.</strong> Deliverability-checked, not just format-validated. Stop damaging your sender reputation.</li>
          <li><strong>Direct dial phone numbers.</strong> The numbers that actually get answered, not main office lines.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile numbers.</strong> Higher connect rates than desk phones. Increasingly essential for outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>LinkedIn profiles.</strong> Verified and current. We catch when someone's left a company.</li>
          <li><strong>Job titles and seniority.</strong> Standardized for filtering. Know who's a decision-maker versus influencer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Company Data</h3>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> NAICS, SIC, or custom taxonomies. Standardized codes, not free text.</li>
          <li><strong>Employee count.</strong> Current headcount from multiple sources. Not self-reported guesses.</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue range.</strong> Annual revenue bands for prioritization and segmentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use. CRM, MAP, cloud infrastructure, and more.</li>
          <li><strong>Funding and growth signals.</strong> Recent rounds, headcount changes, expansion news.</li>
          <li><strong>Parent/subsidiary mapping.</strong> Know which accounts are related. Stop competing with yourself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, or send a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and identify gaps.</strong> Before enriching anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Coverage rates by field. What we can fill.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from LinkedIn, company websites, SEC filings, job postings, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch edge cases. Industry classifications that need judgment. Companies with similar names.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Enriched data returned.</strong> Same format you sent. Ready to import and use.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>B2B data enrichment runs $0.10-0.50 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full contact plus firmographic enrichment is at the higher end. Single-field enrichment is lower.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
