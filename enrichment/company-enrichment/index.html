        <h2>The Company Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Look at your CRM's account records. How many have complete firmographic data? Not just a company name and website, but industry, employee count, revenue, location, and tech stack. If you're like most companies, the answer is somewhere between "not many" and "almost none."</p>

        <p>Data accumulates from different sources over time. Form fills where people self-report (and often lie or guess). Imported lists from vendors. Manual entry by sales reps who captured what they needed for that deal and nothing else. The result is inconsistent coverage. Some accounts have everything. Most have gaps.</p>

        <p>Those gaps break your go-to-market operations. You can't segment by company size if half your accounts have no employee count. You can't prioritize by revenue if the field is blank for 40% of your database. You can't route leads by industry if your classifications are inconsistent or missing entirely.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had 50,000 accounts accumulated over 17 years. Industry classifications were missing for thousands of records. Employee counts were blank for nearly 10% of the database. They couldn't tell MSPs from end customers from distributors because the data had never been standardized.</p>

        <p>After enrichment, we achieved 98.6% industry classification coverage and 91.8% employee count coverage. More importantly, we found 703 MSP accounts that had been hiding in generic "Partner" categories. At their average deal size, that segment alone represented $875K in new ARR potential.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> NAICS, SIC, or custom taxonomies. Standardized codes that actually work for filtering and reporting, not free-text guesses.</li>

          <li><strong>Employee count.</strong> Current headcount verified against multiple sources. Not self-reported numbers from five years ago. Actual company size for accurate segmentation.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue range.</strong> Annual revenue bands for prioritization. Know which accounts have budget and which ones are too small to pursue.</li>

          <li><strong>Headquarters location.</strong> Full address including city, state, and country. Critical for territory assignment and regional targeting.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use. CRM, marketing automation, cloud infrastructure, and more. Know if they're running your competitors or complementary solutions.</li>

          <li><strong>Funding history.</strong> Investment rounds, amounts, and investors. Companies with fresh funding have budget. Companies burning cash might not.</li>

          <li><strong>Parent/subsidiary mapping.</strong> Know which accounts are divisions of the same company. Stop accidentally competing with yourself or treating one organization as three separate opportunities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your accounts.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, or send a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze coverage gaps.</strong> Before enriching anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Coverage rates by field. What percentage we can fill.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, LinkedIn, SEC filings, job postings, business registrations, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Companies with similar names. Subsidiaries that might be separate entries. Industries that require judgment calls. Automation handles scale, humans handle exceptions.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Enriched data delivered.</strong> Same format you sent. Ready to import back into your CRM with complete firmographic profiles.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Company enrichment runs $0.10-0.35 per account, depending on how many attributes you need. Core firmographics (industry, employee count, revenue) are at the lower end. Full enrichment including technology stack and funding data is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data and understanding your enrichment priorities.</p>
