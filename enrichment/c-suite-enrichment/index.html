        <h2>The Executive Access Problem</h2>

        <p>Your CRM has the company. Maybe it has a few contacts. But they're the wrong contacts. The person who downloaded a whitepaper three years ago. An info@ address that goes to a shared inbox. A contact who left the company last quarter.</p>

        <p>When you sell to enterprises, you eventually need to reach executives. The CEO, CFO, CTO, or whoever controls the budget for what you're selling. Getting through to them requires accurate contact information. Direct lines. Personal emails. LinkedIn profiles they actually check.</p>

        <p>Generic contact data won't cut it. Executives don't answer calls to the main office number. Their assistants filter emails to the company domain. The only way in is through the side door, which means direct contact information that bypasses the gatekeepers.</p>

        <p>The challenge is that executive data decays faster than typical contact data. C-level tenure has been shrinking for years. A CFO might last 4-5 years on average. CMOs often less. So the CEO you researched last quarter might already be at a different company.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified email addresses.</strong> Personal work emails, not generic company addresses. Deliverability verified, not just format checked. We catch the bounces before you damage your sender reputation.</li>

          <li><strong>Direct dial phone numbers.</strong> The number that rings on their desk, not the main switchboard. Skip the receptionist, skip the assistant, get straight through.</li>

          <li><strong>Mobile numbers.</strong> For the executives who never sit at a desk. Higher connect rates than office lines. Increasingly essential for reaching busy executives.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn profiles.</strong> Verified and current. We confirm they're still at the company before delivery. LinkedIn often works when email and phone don't.</li>

          <li><strong>Tenure and history.</strong> How long they've been in the role. Previous companies and positions. Board memberships. Context that helps you craft a relevant outreach.</li>

          <li><strong>Role verification.</strong> Not just title matching. We verify they're actually in the decision-making role you need, not someone with a fancy title but no budget authority.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Define your targets.</strong> Which companies? Which executive roles? CEO only, or do you also need the CFO and CTO? We customize the search to your exact requirements.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Send us your account list.</strong> Or give us criteria and we'll build the target list. Either way, you'll know exactly which executives we're finding.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We research and verify.</strong> Cross-referencing multiple sources. Checking employment status. Verifying contact information is current and accurate.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enriched contacts delivered.</strong> Complete executive profiles with all available contact channels. You'll know who to reach and how to reach them.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>C-suite enrichment runs $1.00-3.00 per executive contact, depending on how many data points you need and how difficult the executives are to find. Basic email and LinkedIn is lower. Full contact with direct dial and mobile is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your target list and requirements.</p>
