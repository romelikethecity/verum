<h2>C-Suite Enrichment</h2>
<p>C-suite enrichment identifies and appends contact information for executive-level decision-makers at your target companies. We find CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, COOs, CMOs, and other C-level executives with their direct email addresses, phone numbers, and LinkedIn profiles.</p>

<p>Enterprise sales requires reaching executives, but executive contact data is the hardest to find and fastest to go stale. C-suite turnover averages 15-20% annually. The CEO email in your CRM from last year might belong to someone who's been gone for six months. Generic info@ addresses don't reach decision-makers.</p>

<h2>How We Find C-Suite Contacts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Executive identification.</strong> We identify current C-suite members at each target company using SEC filings, LinkedIn, press releases, and company website leadership pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact discovery.</strong> For each executive, we find direct email addresses (not generic company emails), direct phone numbers, and LinkedIn profile URLs.</li>
    <li><strong>Verification and recency check.</strong> We verify that each executive is still in their role and that contact information is current — not leftover from a previous position.</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting structure context.</strong> Where available, we identify the executive's direct reports and board relationships to map the decision-making structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What C-Suite Enrichment Delivers</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Verified names and titles for C-level executives at each target company</li>
    <li>Direct email addresses (personal business email, not info@ or generic aliases)</li>
    <li>Direct phone numbers and LinkedIn profile URLs</li>
    <li>Tenure data showing how long each executive has been in their current role</li>
</ul>
