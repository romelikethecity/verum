<h2>Buyer Intent Enrichment</h2>
<p>Buyer intent enrichment identifies companies showing active purchase signals for your product category. We append intent scores and topic signals to your account list so your team can prioritize companies that are in-market right now, not just companies that fit your ICP on paper.</p>

<p>Your ICP list has 5,000 accounts. Your team can only work 500 this quarter. Without intent data, you're prioritizing by gut feeling or company size. Intent signals tell you which of those 5,000 are actually researching solutions like yours this month — so your outreach arrives when buyers are ready to talk.</p>

<h2>How We Enrich with Intent Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Topic definition.</strong> We define the intent topics that matter for your business: your product category, competitor names, problem keywords, and related technology terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Signal matching.</strong> We match your account list against intent data providers to identify which accounts are showing above-baseline research activity on your topics.</li>
    <li><strong>Surge scoring.</strong> Accounts get scored based on how much their research activity exceeds their normal baseline — a company researching 3x more than usual is a stronger signal than one doing 1.2x.</li>
    <li><strong>Timeline tracking.</strong> We flag when intent surges started and whether they're increasing or declining, so you can see buying cycle momentum.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Intent-Enriched Data Reveals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Intent scores for every account on your list showing who's actively researching your category</li>
    <li>Topic-level breakdown showing which specific subjects each account is researching</li>
    <li>Surge trend data showing whether buying interest is increasing or cooling</li>
    <li>Competitive intent signals showing which accounts are also researching your competitors</li>
</ul>
