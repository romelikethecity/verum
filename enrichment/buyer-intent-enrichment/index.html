        <h2>The Timing Problem</h2>

        <p>You have a list of target accounts. Some of them will buy from you this quarter. Most won't. The challenge is figuring out which is which before your competitors do.</p>

        <p>Traditional firmographic data tells you who might be a good fit. Intent data tells you who's actively looking right now. Company size and industry don't change week to week. Buying behavior does.</p>

        <p>Without intent signals, you're treating all accounts the same. Equal outreach to companies actively evaluating vendors and companies that won't think about your category for another year. Same campaigns, same cadences, same wasted effort on accounts that aren't ready.</p>

        <p>The companies that get there first often win. Not because their product is better, but because they showed up when the buyer was actively looking.</p>

        <h2>What Intent Signals Tell You</h2>

        <p>Intent data captures digital behavior that suggests buying interest. When someone at a company reads articles about your category, visits competitor websites, searches for related keywords, or downloads relevant content, those actions create signals.</p>

        <p>No single signal means much. Someone reading one article isn't a buyer. But when multiple people at the same company show sustained interest over weeks, that's a pattern worth acting on.</p>

        <p>We aggregate signals from content publishers, review sites like G2 and TrustRadius, search behavior data, and specialized intent providers. Multiple sources, multiple signal types, scored together for reliability.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Topic-based intent scores.</strong> Which accounts are researching topics relevant to your product. Customized to your category and competitive landscape.</li>

          <li><strong>Surge detection.</strong> Accounts showing abnormally high activity compared to their baseline. A spike in research often precedes a buying decision.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitor research signals.</strong> Accounts actively evaluating your competitors. Sometimes the best time to reach out is when they're already looking at alternatives.</li>

          <li><strong>Content consumption patterns.</strong> What types of content they're engaging with. Awareness-stage versus decision-stage content tells you where they are in the journey.</li>

          <li><strong>Account prioritization.</strong> Rank your target accounts by intent strength. Focus outbound on the accounts most likely to engage.</li>

          <li><strong>CRM integration.</strong> Intent scores appended to your existing records. Update lead scoring and routing based on real-time signals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Define your topics.</strong> What keywords and categories matter for your product? We configure intent tracking for your specific market.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Send us your accounts.</strong> Your target account list, CRM export, or defined criteria for the accounts you want to monitor.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We match and score.</strong> Cross-reference your accounts against intent signal sources. Score accounts by signal strength and recency.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Prioritized list delivered.</strong> Accounts ranked by intent score, with signal details. Know who to call first and why.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing monitoring (optional).</strong> Intent changes constantly. We can provide weekly or monthly refreshes to keep prioritization current.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Intent enrichment runs $0.20-0.50 per account for one-time scoring. Ongoing monitoring is priced separately based on account volume and refresh frequency.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your target accounts and topics.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What is buyer intent data?</h3>
          <p>Buyer intent data tracks which companies are actively researching topics related to your product. It's based on content consumption, search behavior, and engagement patterns that signal a company is in-market.</p>

          <h3>How do you collect intent signals?</h3>
          <p>We aggregate signals from content publishers, review sites, search patterns, and third-party intent providers. Multiple signals create more reliable intent scores.</p>

          <h3>How fresh is the intent data?</h3>
          <p>Intent signals are time-sensitive. We provide data current within 30-90 days, depending on signal type. Older intent data loses predictive value quickly.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich our existing accounts with intent scores?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Send us your account list and we'll identify which ones are showing intent signals for your category.</p>
