        <h2>The Domain-to-Account Problem</h2>

        <p>You have domains. Maybe from email addresses in your database. Maybe from website visitor tracking. Maybe from a list you scraped or purchased. Either way, all you have is a domain, and you need to know who that company actually is.</p>

        <p>Manual research takes forever. Open the website, poke around, try to figure out what they do, how big they are, where they're located. Maybe check LinkedIn. Maybe find a press release. Ten minutes per domain if you're fast. That doesn't scale.</p>

        <p>Domain enrichment solves this. You give us a domain, we give you everything we know about the company. Industry, employee count, revenue range, headquarters, technology stack, funding history. One domain in, complete company profile out.</p>

        <p>Common use case: you're running website visitor identification and getting company domains from IP lookups. Those domains are useless until you know who they are. Are they in your ICP? Are they big enough? Are they in your territory? Domain enrichment answers those questions instantly.</p>

        <h2>What We Derive from a Domain</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Company identification.</strong> Legal name, DBA names, and any parent/subsidiary relationships. Know exactly who you're dealing with.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> NAICS, SIC, or custom taxonomy. Standardized codes for filtering and segmentation.</li>

          <li><strong>Company size.</strong> Employee count and size bands. Know if they're a 10-person startup or a 10,000-person enterprise.</li>

          <li><strong>Headquarters location.</strong> Full address including city, state, and country. Critical for territory assignment.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use. CRM, marketing automation, cloud infrastructure. Know if they're potential customers.</li>

          <li><strong>Funding data.</strong> Investment history, amounts, and investors. Understand their financial position.</li>

          <li><strong>Social profiles.</strong> LinkedIn company page, Twitter, and other social presence. Additional context and research starting points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your domains.</strong> A list of domains, email addresses (we'll extract the domains), or whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We filter and match.</strong> Personal domains (gmail, yahoo) get flagged out. Business domains get matched against company databases.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Full company profiles built.</strong> For each matched domain, we pull all available firmographic, technographic, and funding data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enriched data delivered.</strong> Each domain with complete company profile. Ready for import, scoring, and routing.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Domain enrichment runs $0.10-0.30 per domain, depending on how many data fields you need. Basic identification and firmographics are lower. Full profiles with technographics and funding data are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your domain list and data requirements.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What data can you derive from a domain?</h3>
          <p>Company name, industry, employee count, location, technology stack, funding, and sometimes key contacts. One domain becomes a complete profile.</p>

          <h3>What's your match rate on domain enrichment?</h3>
          <p>85-95% for basic firmographics on legitimate business domains. Specialized data like funding runs 60-80%.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle domains from website visitors?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Common use case. Turn visitor company domains into full profiles for intent-based marketing.</p>

          <h3>What about personal or non-business domains?</h3>
          <p>We identify and flag them (gmail, yahoo, etc.) so you can filter them out. We focus on business domains.</p>
