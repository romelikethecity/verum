        <h2>The Routing Problem</h2>

        <p>Lead routing should be simple. Marketing leads go to the marketing-focused rep. Technical leads go to the technical rep. Enterprise accounts get enterprise attention. But routing depends on knowing who you're routing.</p>

        <p>Job titles alone don't tell you the department. "Manager" could be anywhere. "Director of Operations" could be IT, could be Sales, could be logistics. And creative titles like "Growth Hacker" or "Evangelist" tell you almost nothing about where they sit in the org chart.</p>

        <p>Without department data, your routing rules break. The wrong rep gets the wrong lead. Your messaging is generic because you can't personalize by function. Your conversion rates suffer because prospects hear a pitch designed for someone else.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had 120,000+ contact records with job titles but no standardized departments. Their routing was essentially random. After we mapped all titles to a consistent department taxonomy, their lead-to-meeting conversion improved by 15%. Same leads, better routing, more meetings.</p>

        <h2>Departments We Identify</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Sales and Business Development.</strong> AEs, SDRs, Sales Managers, Business Development, Partnerships. Revenue-focused roles.</li>

          <li><strong>Marketing.</strong> Demand gen, content, product marketing, brand, growth. All variations standardized to one category.</li>

          <li><strong>Engineering and Product.</strong> Software engineers, DevOps, QA, product managers, technical architects. The builders.</li>

          <li><strong>IT and Security.</strong> Sys admins, network engineers, security analysts, IT managers. Infrastructure and security teams.</li>

          <li><strong>Finance and Accounting.</strong> CFOs, controllers, FP&A, accountants. Budget holders and financial decision-makers.</li>

          <li><strong>HR and People.</strong> Recruiters, HR managers, people ops, talent acquisition. Workforce management.</li>

          <li><strong>Operations.</strong> RevOps, BizOps, logistics, supply chain, project management. The operational backbone.</li>

          <li><strong>Customer Success and Support.</strong> CSMs, support reps, implementation specialists. Post-sale teams.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contacts.</strong> Export from your CRM with job titles. Even partial titles or messy data work.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We map and classify.</strong> Analyzing job titles against our taxonomy, considering company context and industry patterns.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on ambiguous cases.</strong> Some titles genuinely span departments. Some are company-specific and need judgment. We resolve before delivery.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Standardized departments returned.</strong> Each contact tagged with primary department and sub-function. Ready for routing rules and segmentation.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Department enrichment runs $0.03-0.08 per contact, depending on volume and how granular you need the classification. Basic department tags are lower. Detailed sub-function mapping is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What departments do you identify?</h3>
          <p>Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Product, Finance, HR, IT, Operations, Legal, Customer Success, and more. Standardized to a consistent taxonomy.</p>

          <h3>How do you determine department from job title?</h3>
          <p>We combine keyword analysis, company structure, and industry patterns. Context matters for ambiguous titles.</p>

          <h3>Why does department matter?</h3>
          <p>Department determines who buys and how to message them. Routing developers to marketing reps wastes everyone's time.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify multiple departments for one contact?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Some roles span departments. We flag the primary and note secondary affiliations when relevant.</p>
        </div>
