<h2>Department Enrichment</h2>
<p>Department enrichment classifies your contacts into functional departments based on their job titles: marketing, sales, engineering, finance, HR, operations, IT, legal, and more. This lets you segment your outreach by department, route leads to the right sales team, and measure penetration by function within target accounts.</p>

<p>Job titles are messy and inconsistent. 'Growth Marketing Manager' and 'Digital Marketing Specialist' both belong in marketing, but your CRM can't tell without a standardized department field. Without department data, you can't filter your database by function or route leads to the rep who handles that buyer persona.</p>

<h2>How We Classify Departments</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Title parsing and normalization.</strong> We parse every job title in your database and map it to a standardized department classification using NLP and pattern matching.</li>
    <li><strong>Seniority layer.</strong> Each contact gets both a department and a seniority level, so you can filter for 'VP-level in Marketing' or 'Director-level in Engineering.'</li>
    <li><strong>Department-level account mapping.</strong> For target accounts, we show how many contacts you have in each department to identify gaps in buying committee coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom taxonomy support.</strong> If your business uses non-standard department names or needs custom groupings, we map to your taxonomy instead of a generic one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Department-Enriched Data Enables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Standardized department classification for every contact in your database</li>
    <li>Seniority level (C-suite, VP, Director, Manager, IC) paired with department</li>
    <li>Account-level department coverage showing where you have contacts and where you don't</li>
    <li>Custom department mapping aligned to your sales team structure and buyer personas</li>
</ul>
