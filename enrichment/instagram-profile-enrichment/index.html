        <h2>When Instagram Data Matters</h2>

        <p>Instagram isn't LinkedIn. It's not the default professional network for most industries. But for certain audiences, it's everything.</p>

        <p>Creators and influencers. Fashion, beauty, design, and photography professionals. Real estate agents showcasing properties. Fitness instructors, wellness coaches, food and beverage brands. D2C founders who built their businesses on the platform. For these people, Instagram is their primary professional identity.</p>

        <p>If you're building an influencer marketing platform, you need Instagram handles at scale. If you're doing creator outreach for brand partnerships, you need handles. If you're selling to visual industries where portfolio presence matters more than LinkedIn connections, you need handles.</p>

        <p>We help you find them, verify them, and deliver them ready for outreach or platform integration.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Profile handle matching.</strong> Connect your contact records to their Instagram presence. Names, companies, and other signals triangulated to find the right account.</li>

          <li><strong>Creator vs brand separation.</strong> Personal creator accounts and brand business accounts clearly labeled. Different uses, different outreach approaches.</li>

          <li><strong>Profile verification.</strong> Cross-referencing against available signals to ensure you have the right person. Confidence flags on ambiguous matches.</li>

          <li><strong>Basic metrics (optional).</strong> Follower counts and account status. For deeper analytics, we can point you to specialized tools.</li>

          <li><strong>Activity indicators.</strong> Active accounts versus dormant ones. Post frequency when available. Helps prioritize outreach to engaged users.</li>

          <li><strong>No-match flagging.</strong> Not everyone has Instagram, especially in traditional B2B. We clearly mark who doesn't have a findable profile.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contact list.</strong> Names, companies, emails, whatever you have. Tell us about your audience so we can set expectations.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We search and verify.</strong> Finding Instagram handles and cross-referencing to ensure accurate matches.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Common names, multiple potential matches, and ambiguous cases get manual review.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Instagram data delivered.</strong> Verified handles with confidence indicators. Ready for outreach, platform sync, or research.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Who needs Instagram profile enrichment?</h3>
          <p>Influencer platforms, creator economy tools, D2C brands doing partnerships, agencies managing creators, and companies selling to visual industries (fashion, design, photography, real estate).</p>

          <h3>What's your match rate?</h3>
          <p>For creators and influencers, often 70%+. For traditional B2B contacts, much lower (20-40%). Instagram is demographic-specific. We'll estimate for your audience.</p>

          <h3>Can you provide follower counts?</h3>
          <p>Profile URLs are standard. Follower counts and basic metrics available for additional fee. For deep influencer analytics, specialized platforms might be more appropriate.</p>

          <h3>Personal accounts or brand accounts?</h3>
          <p>Both, depending on your needs. We can separate them in your deliverable.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Good Fit vs. Not a Good Fit</h2>

        <p>Instagram enrichment works well for:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Influencer marketing platforms needing handles at scale</li>
          <li>D2C brands doing creator partnership outreach</li>
          <li>Companies selling to fashion, design, photography, real estate</li>
          <li>Creator economy tools integrating social presence data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It probably doesn't make sense for:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Traditional B2B prospecting (start with LinkedIn)</li>
          <li>Enterprise software sales (wrong platform)</li>
          <li>Audiences where Instagram adoption is low</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unsure about your audience? Send us a sample. We'll estimate match rates and tell you honestly whether this makes sense for your use case.</p>
