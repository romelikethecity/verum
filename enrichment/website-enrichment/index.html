<h2>Website Enrichment</h2>
<p>Website enrichment extracts structured data from company websites and appends it to your records: what the company does, how they describe their products, who their customers are, what their messaging emphasizes, and what technologies power the site. This goes beyond firmographic databases to capture what the company says about itself.</p>

<p>Before every call, your reps visit the prospect's website. They spend 3-5 minutes scanning the homepage, about page, and product pages to figure out what the company does and how to position your pitch. Website enrichment automates this research step across your entire database.</p>

<h2>How We Extract Website Intelligence</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Homepage and about page analysis.</strong> We extract the company's self-description, mission statement, and key messaging from their primary web pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Product and service identification.</strong> We identify what products or services the company offers based on their website content and navigation structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer signals.</strong> We detect case studies, testimonials, and customer logos that reveal the company's target market and customer base.</li>
    <li><strong>Website metadata extraction.</strong> We capture meta descriptions, page titles, and structured data (schema.org) that companies use to describe themselves to search engines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Website Enrichment Delivers</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Company description extracted from their own website content</li>
    <li>Products and services identified from website navigation and content</li>
    <li>Customer segment indicators based on case studies and testimonials</li>
    <li>Website technology stack detected from the site's infrastructure</li>
</ul>
