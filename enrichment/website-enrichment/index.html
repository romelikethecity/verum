        <h2>The Foundation Problem</h2>

        <p>You have a list of company names. Maybe from an event, a purchased list, or internal records that were never properly maintained. The company names are there. The domains aren't.</p>

        <p>Without domains, you're stuck. Can't detect their technology stack. Can't derive email patterns. Can't verify they're a real, active business. Can't do much of anything except manual research, one company at a time.</p>

        <p>Website enrichment solves this foundational problem. Match company names to their verified domains. Now you have something to work with. Now tech stack detection works. Now email pattern derivation works. Now you can actually enrich and research at scale.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Company-to-domain matching.</strong> "Acme Corporation" becomes "acme.com". Name variations, location context, and multiple signals combined for accurate matching.</li>

          <li><strong>Domain verification.</strong> We check that domains resolve, aren't parked or expired, and lead to active company websites.</li>

          <li><strong>Disambiguation handling.</strong> "Apple" in Cupertino is different from "Apple" in Iowa. We use all available context to find the right company.</li>

          <li><strong>Subsidiary and regional handling.</strong> Primary corporate domain by default. Subsidiaries, regional sites, and brand domains available on request.</li>

          <li><strong>Website status indicators.</strong> Active, redirecting, under construction. Know what you're getting.</li>

          <li><strong>No-match flagging.</strong> When we can't find a verified domain, we tell you clearly. No guessing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Domains Unlock Everything</h2>

        <p>Domains are the key to company-level intelligence:</p>

        <p><strong>Technology detection.</strong> Can't scan a tech stack without a website to scan. Domains enable technographic enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Email patterns.</strong> firstname.lastname@domain.com. firstname@domain.com. Without the domain, you're guessing.</p>

        <p><strong>Company verification.</strong> A real website confirms you're dealing with a real company, not a typo or a business that closed.</p>

        <p><strong>Further enrichment.</strong> Many data providers key off domains. Website enrichment enables everything that comes after.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names and whatever else you have. Location, industry, any identifiers. More context means better matching.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We match and verify.</strong> Finding domains through multiple sources and verifying they're active company websites.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on ambiguous cases.</strong> Common company names and unclear matches get manual review.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Website data delivered.</strong> Each company with verified domain, status indicators, and confidence flags. Ready for further enrichment.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Website enrichment runs $0.03-0.08 per company, depending on volume and data quality. Clean company names with location data match more easily than ambiguous names alone.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data quality and expected match rates.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why is website enrichment foundational?</h3>
          <p>Domains unlock everything else. Tech stack detection, email patterns, company verification. Without the domain, other enrichment isn't possible.</p>

          <h3>How do you match names to domains?</h3>
          <p>Multiple signals: name variations, location, industry, business databases. We disambiguate using all available context.</p>

          <h3>What about companies with multiple domains?</h3>
          <p>Primary corporate domain by default. Subsidiaries, regional sites, and brand domains available on request.</p>

          <h3>Do you verify websites are active?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We check that domains resolve and aren't parked, expired, or redirecting. Active company websites only.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Build the Foundation?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to test accuracy?</strong> Send us a sample of company names. We'll match them to domains and show you the results.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to enrich?</strong> Send us your full list. We'll return verified domains so you can move on to tech stack, email patterns, and other enrichment.</p>
