<h2>Company Revenue Enrichment</h2>
<p>Company revenue enrichment appends estimated annual revenue data to your company records. For public companies, we use reported financials. For private companies, we estimate revenue using employee count, industry benchmarks, technology signals, and other proxy data to give you actionable size segmentation.</p>

<p>Revenue is the most requested and hardest to get firmographic data point. Private companies don't disclose it. Self-reported data on forms is unreliable. Without revenue data, you can't segment your market by company size, set pricing tiers, or calculate TAM. You end up treating a $5M company the same as a $500M company.</p>

<h2>How We Estimate Company Revenue</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Public company financials.</strong> For public companies, we append actual reported revenue from SEC filings and financial databases.</li>
    <li><strong>Private company estimation.</strong> We estimate private company revenue using models based on employee count, industry revenue-per-employee benchmarks, and technology spend signals.</li>
    <li><strong>Revenue range assignment.</strong> Each company gets a revenue range (e.g., $1M-$5M, $5M-$10M, $10M-$25M) rather than a false-precision single number.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth signal detection.</strong> Where possible, we flag companies showing revenue growth signals: hiring velocity, office expansion, and funding activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Revenue-Enriched Data Shows</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Revenue range estimates for both public and private companies</li>
    <li>Source flag indicating whether revenue is reported (public) or estimated (private)</li>
    <li>Confidence scoring on estimates so you know how reliable each data point is</li>
    <li>Revenue-based size segmentation (SMB, mid-market, enterprise) for targeting</li>
</ul>
