        <h2>The Pricing Problem</h2>

        <p>Revenue determines what companies can buy. A 10-person startup with $1M in ARR has different budget constraints than a 500-person company doing $100M. Your pricing tier, your sales motion, even whether you should pursue them at all depends on their ability to pay.</p>

        <p>Without revenue data, you're guessing. That "small company" might actually be a profitable boutique doing $20M with just 15 employees. That "large company" might be a venture-funded startup burning cash with no real budget authority. Employee count alone doesn't tell you who can afford what.</p>

        <p>Revenue segmentation drives everything downstream. Which accounts get enterprise attention versus self-serve nudges. Which leads justify a demo versus a nurture sequence. How you position pricing in the first conversation.</p>

        <p>An ICP analysis we did for a B2B enrichment platform found that companies in the $5M-25M revenue range had 62% win rates compared to 34% for companies below $5M. Same product, same pitch, dramatically different outcomes. Without revenue data, they had been treating all accounts equally. That was costing them deals they should have been closing and wasting effort on deals that would never happen.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Annual revenue figures.</strong> Exact amounts for public companies from SEC filings. Estimates for private companies based on multiple correlated signals.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue ranges.</strong> Banded categories (Under $1M, $1M-10M, $10M-50M, $50M-100M, $100M+) when exact figures aren't available or when you prefer ranges for segmentation.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue per employee.</strong> Efficiency indicator that helps distinguish lean, profitable operations from overstaffed cash-burners. A 50-person company doing $50M is very different from one doing $5M.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue growth indicators.</strong> Growing versus stable versus declining. Companies on a growth trajectory often have expanding budgets. Declining companies might be cutting.</li>

          <li><strong>Confidence scores.</strong> We tell you how confident we are in each estimate. Public company data is certain. Private company estimates range from high confidence (many signals) to directional (limited data).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your accounts.</strong> Your CRM export, target list, or whatever format you have. We'll match against revenue databases.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and estimate.</strong> Cross-referencing SEC filings, employee count, industry benchmarks, funding data, and proprietary signals to generate revenue figures or ranges.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Unusual company structures. Holding companies versus operating companies. Recent M&A that affects numbers. We verify before delivery.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Revenue data delivered.</strong> Each account with revenue figure, range, and confidence score. Ready for segmentation and prioritization.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Revenue enrichment runs $0.08-0.20 per account, depending on whether you need exact figures, ranges, or both, and how deep you want the analysis. Basic revenue band classification is lower. Full revenue profile with growth indicators is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your account list.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How accurate is your revenue data?</h3>
          <p>Public companies are exact from SEC filings. Private companies are estimates that typically fall within the correct revenue band 80-90% of the time.</p>

          <h3>Do you provide exact figures or ranges?</h3>
          <p>Both when possible. Public companies get exact figures. Private companies get ranges based on available signals. You can specify your preference.</p>

          <h3>Where does the revenue data come from?</h3>
          <p>SEC filings for public companies. For private companies, we model estimates from employee count, industry averages, funding history, and other correlated signals.</p>

          <h3>How often does revenue data change?</h3>
          <p>Public company data updates quarterly. Private company estimates update when significant signals change. Annual refresh is typically sufficient.</p>
