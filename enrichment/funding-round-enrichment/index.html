<h2>Funding Round Enrichment</h2>
<p>Funding round enrichment appends detailed investment round data to your company records: round type, amount raised, date, lead investors, and post-money valuation where available. This gives your sales and marketing teams the context to prioritize accounts by growth trajectory and spending capacity.</p>

<p>Funding announcements are scattered across press releases, Crunchbase, PitchBook, and SEC filings. Manually checking each company in your pipeline takes forever. Without funding context, your team treats a bootstrapped lifestyle business the same as a company that just closed a $50M growth round — even though their buying behavior is completely different.</p>

<h2>How We Enrich Funding Round Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Database aggregation.</strong> We pull from Crunchbase, PitchBook, SEC filings, and press databases to build a comprehensive funding history for each company.</li>
    <li><strong>Round classification.</strong> Each round gets classified by type: pre-seed, seed, Series A through F, growth equity, bridge, convertible note, PE buyout, and IPO.</li>
    <li><strong>Investor identification.</strong> Lead investors and notable participants are identified for each round, which can indicate the company's strategic direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Recency and trajectory scoring.</strong> We score companies by how recently they raised and whether their funding trajectory is accelerating or plateau.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Funding Round Data Reveals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Complete funding history with round type, amount, date, and lead investors</li>
    <li>Total capital raised to date for each company</li>
    <li>Most recent round details with recency flag (last 90 days, 6 months, 12 months)</li>
    <li>Funding stage classification for segmentation (early, growth, late, public)</li>
</ul>
