        <h2>The Timing Problem</h2>

        <p>Two companies look identical on paper. Same industry, same size, same ICP fit. But one just closed a $30M Series B and is hiring 50 people. The other hasn't raised in three years and is running lean. Which one is more likely to buy?</p>

        <p>Funding changes everything about how a company operates. Post-funding, there's pressure to grow fast. Hire people, buy tools, expand infrastructure, prove the investment was worth it. That pressure creates buying urgency that doesn't exist at bootstrapped or late-stage companies running on profitability.</p>

        <p>The challenge is knowing who just raised. TechCrunch catches the big rounds, but most funding announcements fly under the radar. Your team isn't spending their morning reading Crunchbase alerts. So the insight that could prioritize your best opportunities gets missed.</p>

        <p>We've seen sales teams restructure their entire outbound motion around funding signals. Instead of alphabetically working through territory lists, they prioritize recently funded companies. Connect rates go up because these companies are actively building. Close rates go up because they have budget.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Funding stage.</strong> Seed, Series A, B, C, D, and beyond. Different stages signal different priorities and buying patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Last funding date.</strong> Know how recent the money came in. A company 6 months post-funding is still in growth mode. Three years post-funding is a different story.</li>

          <li><strong>Total funding amount.</strong> Cumulative capital raised. Indicates the scale of resources available.</li>

          <li><strong>Last round amount.</strong> The most recent raise. A $5M seed is different from a $100M growth round.</li>

          <li><strong>Investors.</strong> Who invested. Tier-1 VCs often push portfolio companies toward specific vendors. Useful context for sales conversations.</li>

          <li><strong>Funding velocity.</strong> Time between rounds. Fast raisers are executing and growing. Slow raisers might be struggling.</li>

          <li><strong>Public market data.</strong> For public companies, market cap, recent stock performance, and relevant financial indicators.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names or domains. We'll match against funding databases.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We pull funding history.</strong> Cross-referencing Crunchbase, PitchBook, SEC filings, press releases, and proprietary sources.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Recency flagging.</strong> Companies with recent funding get highlighted. You know who's in active buying mode.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Complete funding profiles delivered.</strong> Each company with stage, amounts, dates, and investors. Ready for prioritization.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Funding round enrichment runs $0.10-0.25 per company, depending on depth needed. Basic funding stage and last round is lower. Full investment history with all investors and timeline is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your company list.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What funding data do you provide?</h3>
          <p>Funding stage, last funding date, total amount raised, last round amount, lead investors, and full investor list. For public companies, market cap and performance data.</p>

          <h3>How recent is your funding data?</h3>
          <p>We track announcements within days of public disclosure. We can flag recent funding events so you time outreach when budgets are fresh.</p>

          <h3>Why does funding matter for sales?</h3>
          <p>Funded companies are in growth mode. They're hiring, buying tools, building infrastructure. They have budget and urgency that bootstrapped companies often lack.</p>

          <h3>What's your coverage on funding data?</h3>
          <p>85-95% for US VC-backed companies. Lower for bootstrapped or international firms that don't publicly disclose funding. We flag where data isn't available.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Prioritize Funded Companies?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see who's recently funded?</strong> Send us your target account list. We'll flag which companies have raised in the last 12 months.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to enrich at scale?</strong> Send us your full company database. We'll add funding data so your team can prioritize accounts with budget.</p>
