        <p class="page-hero__subtitle">Employee count is the most reliable sizing metric for B2B targeting — and most of your records don't have it.</p>

<h2>Company Size Enrichment</h2>
<p>Company size enrichment appends employee count data to your company records. We use LinkedIn employee counts, job posting volume, and other signals to estimate how many people work at each company. This is the foundation for size-based segmentation, lead scoring, and TAM calculation.</p>

<p>Without employee count, you can't separate a 10-person startup from a 10,000-person enterprise. They both show up as 'company' in your CRM. Size determines pricing, sales process, buying committee complexity, and product fit. It's the single most useful firmographic field for B2B targeting.</p>

<h2>How We Determine Company Size</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>LinkedIn employee count.</strong> LinkedIn company pages show employee counts that are directionally accurate for most companies with 20+ employees.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-source validation.</strong> We cross-reference LinkedIn data with job posting volume, office size indicators, and industry databases to validate and improve accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Size band assignment.</strong> Each company gets placed in a size band: 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001+ employees.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth rate flagging.</strong> We compare current employee count to historical data to flag companies that are growing or shrinking rapidly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Size-Enriched Records Include</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Employee count estimate and size band for every company in your database</li>
    <li>Growth indicator showing whether headcount is increasing, stable, or declining</li>
    <li>Department-level sizing where available (engineering, sales, marketing headcount)</li>
    <li>Source and confidence score for each estimate</li>
</ul>
