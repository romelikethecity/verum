        <h2>The Segmentation Problem</h2>

        <p>Company size is the most fundamental way to segment accounts. SMB versus mid-market versus enterprise. Your pricing tiers, your sales process, your support model, your product positioning. All of it depends on knowing how big the company actually is.</p>

        <p>But look at your CRM. How many accounts have employee count filled in? And for those that do, how many are accurate? That "50 employees" might have been true three years ago when someone filled out a form. The company could have 500 now. Or 5.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had employee counts blank for nearly 10% of their 50,000 accounts. For the ones that had values, many were self-reported from form fills years ago. Their segmentation was fiction. They were routing mid-market accounts to the SMB team and enterprise accounts to no one.</p>

        <p>After enrichment, we achieved 91.8% employee count coverage. More importantly, we identified accounts that had dramatically changed size since the original data was captured. Some "small businesses" were now 500+ employee enterprises. Some "enterprises" had shrunk to startups after layoffs. The rerouting alone would have justified the project.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Current employee count.</strong> Verified against multiple sources, not self-reported guesses from five years ago. We tell you how many people work there now.</li>

          <li><strong>Size bands.</strong> Standard segmentation categories: 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1000+. Or custom bands that match your sales segments.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth indicators.</strong> Is the company growing, stable, or shrinking? A company that doubled headcount last year is different from one in a hiring freeze.</li>

          <li><strong>Department breakdowns.</strong> When available, we can tell you how big specific departments are. Engineering versus sales versus marketing. Useful for products that sell to specific teams.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn employee count.</strong> What LinkedIn shows as their employee count. Often differs from actual headcount but useful for certain analyses.</li>

          <li><strong>Confidence scores.</strong> How certain we are about each data point. Public company filings are definitive. Private company estimates have ranges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your accounts.</strong> Export from your CRM or send a spreadsheet. Include whatever employee count data you have, even if it's incomplete.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We verify and fill gaps.</strong> Cross-referencing LinkedIn, job postings, company websites, SEC filings, and proprietary databases. We update wrong values and fill missing ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Companies with multiple entities. Recent M&A that affects counts. Contractor-heavy businesses where employee count is misleading.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enriched data delivered.</strong> Same format you sent, with verified employee counts, size bands, and growth indicators.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Company size enrichment runs $0.05-0.15 per account, depending on whether you need just employee count or full size profiles with growth indicators and department breakdowns.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What company size data do you provide?</h3>
          <p>Employee count (exact or ranges), size bands (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise), growth trends, and department breakdowns when available.</p>

          <h3>How accurate is your employee count data?</h3>
          <p>90-95% within the correct size band. Exact counts may vary by +/-10% for private companies. We verify against multiple sources.</p>

          <h3>Do you track headcount changes over time?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We flag whether companies are growing, stable, or shrinking. Growth trajectory matters as much as current size.</p>

          <h3>Why is company size important?</h3>
          <p>Size determines buying capacity, sales motion, feature needs, and support requirements. Most products have a sweet spot. Size data helps you find it.</p>
