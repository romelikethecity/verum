        <h2>The Timing Problem</h2>

        <p>You have a target account list. Maybe a thousand companies, maybe ten thousand. Some of them will buy something like your product this year. Most won't. The question is which ones.</p>

        <p>Without buying signals, your outreach is essentially random. Same messaging to companies that just closed a funding round as to companies in a hiring freeze. Same priority for an account that just fired their incumbent vendor as one locked into a three-year contract. You're playing the averages instead of playing the odds.</p>

        <p>Companies don't buy on your timeline. They buy on theirs. The funding round closes. The new VP joins. The existing solution fails. The budget gets approved. These moments happen constantly across your target accounts. The companies that know about them first get there first.</p>

        <p>We worked with a data protection company that had 50,000 accounts in their database accumulated over 17 years. They'd been treating all accounts equally because they had no way to distinguish which ones were ready to buy. After signal enrichment, they identified 703 MSP accounts showing active buying signals that had been hiding in generic partner categories. At their average deal size, that's $875K in new ARR potential from accounts already sitting in their CRM.</p>

        <h2>What Buying Signals Tell You</h2>

        <p>A buying signal is any change that suggests a company might be ready to purchase. Some signals are obvious. A company announces a $50M Series C and posts 12 new job openings in your buyer persona. Others are subtle. A shift in their technology stack that creates a gap your product fills.</p>

        <p>No single signal means a deal is imminent. But when multiple signals cluster together, that pattern tells you something. The company that just raised funding, hired a new VP of Sales, and started researching solutions in your category isn't browsing. They're buying.</p>

        <h2>Signals We Track</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Funding announcements.</strong> Seed through Series D and beyond. When the money arrives, so does the budget. Fresh funding often means new initiatives and new purchases.</li>

          <li><strong>Executive hiring.</strong> New VPs and C-suite executives typically bring change. A new CMO often means a new marketing stack. A new CRO often means new sales tools.</li>

          <li><strong>Job postings.</strong> What they're hiring for tells you what they're building. A company posting for Salesforce admins is expanding their CRM. A company hiring data engineers is building infrastructure.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology changes.</strong> New tools in their stack create integration needs and displacement opportunities. If they just adopted your competitor, they're in buying mode. If they just dropped them, even better.</li>

          <li><strong>Company growth.</strong> Headcount increases, new office locations, revenue milestones. Growing companies have growing needs.</li>

          <li><strong>Content consumption.</strong> When multiple people at an account research your category, that's intent. When they research your competitors specifically, that's active evaluation.</li>

          <li><strong>Contract renewals.</strong> Most B2B contracts run 1-3 years. Knowing when the incumbent is up for renewal tells you when the window opens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Define what matters.</strong> Which signals indicate buying readiness for your product? Funding might matter more for enterprise deals. Hiring patterns might matter more for tools.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Send us your accounts.</strong> Your target account list, CRM export, or defined criteria. We'll match against signal sources.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We score and prioritize.</strong> Accounts ranked by signal strength, recency, and relevance. Not just which accounts have signals, but which ones have the right signals for you.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Prioritized list delivered.</strong> Each account with its signals, dates, and sources. Your reps know not just who to call, but why.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing monitoring (optional).</strong> Signals change constantly. We can provide weekly or monthly refreshes to keep prioritization current.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Buying signals enrichment runs $0.15-0.40 per account, depending on which signal types you need and how many accounts you're tracking. Single signal type enrichment is lower. Full multi-signal scoring is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your target accounts and signal priorities.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What buying signals do you track?</h3>
          <p>Funding, executive hiring, job postings, technology changes, growth metrics, and content consumption patterns. Multiple signal types combined create stronger predictions.</p>

          <h3>How fresh are buying signals?</h3>
          <p>We provide signals detected within 30-90 days depending on type. Funding announcements stay relevant longer. Hiring surges matter most immediately.</p>

          <h3>How do buying signals differ from intent data?</h3>
          <p>Intent tracks research behavior. Buying signals include organizational changes like funding, hiring, and technology purchases. We provide both.</p>

          <h3>Can you monitor our accounts for new signals?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Weekly or monthly refreshes keep prioritization current as circumstances change across your target accounts.</p>
