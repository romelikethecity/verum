<h2>Buying Signals Enrichment</h2>
<p>Buying signals enrichment appends event-based triggers to your account data: recent funding rounds, executive hires, technology changes, office expansions, and other indicators that a company is likely to make a purchase decision soon. These signals complement intent data by showing concrete business changes, not just research activity.</p>

<p>Intent data tells you a company is researching your category. Buying signals tell you why. A company that just raised a Series B, hired a VP of Sales, and switched CRM platforms isn't browsing — they're building infrastructure and have budget to spend. Without event data, you miss the context that makes outreach relevant.</p>

<h2>How We Detect Buying Signals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Funding event tracking.</strong> We monitor funding announcements to flag companies that recently raised capital — a strong indicator of upcoming technology and vendor purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Leadership change detection.</strong> New executives in relevant roles (CTO, VP Sales, CMO) often trigger vendor reviews and new purchases within their first 6 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology change monitoring.</strong> We detect when companies add or remove technologies from their stack, signaling evaluation cycles and potential displacement opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>Job posting analysis.</strong> Hiring patterns reveal growth areas and priorities. A company posting 10 sales roles is scaling — and likely needs the tools to support that growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Buying Signal Data Shows</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Recent funding events with round size and investor details for each account</li>
    <li>Executive changes in roles relevant to your product's buying committee</li>
    <li>Technology stack changes showing recent additions and removals</li>
    <li>Hiring velocity data showing which departments are growing fastest</li>
</ul>
