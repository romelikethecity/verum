        <h2>The Title Problem</h2>

        <p>Your ICP is "Marketing Leaders at mid-market companies." Simple enough. You filter by title. And you catch "VP of Marketing" and "CMO." But you miss "Head of Demand Gen," "Chief Growth Officer," "Marketing Director," and "VP, Brand & Marketing." Same buyers, different words.</p>

        <p>Job titles have become creative expressions rather than standardized descriptions. Every company invents their own. Startups especially. "Growth Ninja" tells you nothing. "Revenue Operations Specialist" could be sales, marketing, or finance. "Chief Evangelist" could be executive or individual contributor.</p>

        <p>The result is unreliable targeting. Your campaigns miss qualified buyers because they have non-standard titles. Your routing rules send leads to wrong reps. Your ICP analysis is based on incomplete data. Every system that depends on job titles breaks a little.</p>

        <p>We take the chaos and map it to standard categories. Every title classified by function, seniority, and department. Your filters work. Your routing works. Your targeting works.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Standardized title categories.</strong> Map varied titles to consistent categories. All the "VP of Marketing," "Head of Marketing," "Marketing Director" variations become "Marketing Leader."</li>

          <li><strong>Department mapping.</strong> Which department owns this role? Marketing, Sales, Engineering, Finance, HR, Operations. Accurate department assignment for routing.</li>

          <li><strong>Seniority level.</strong> Executive, VP, Director, Manager, Individual Contributor. Know who has budget authority and who doesn't.</li>

          <li><strong>Management indicator.</strong> People manager or individual contributor? A "Senior Engineer" and an "Engineering Manager" have different buying authority.</li>

          <li><strong>Title freshness.</strong> We can verify titles against current LinkedIn data. Catch promotions and role changes before your outreach embarrasses you.</li>

          <li><strong>Original title preserved.</strong> We don't overwrite. You keep the original for context while having standardized fields for filtering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contacts.</strong> Names, companies, and whatever job title data you have. However messy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We classify and standardize.</strong> Analyzing each title for function, seniority, and department. Context matters, so we consider company and industry patterns.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on ambiguous titles.</strong> "Evangelist" at one company might be executive. At another, entry-level. We verify before assigning categories.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Standardized data delivered.</strong> Each contact with original title plus standardized category, department, seniority, and management indicator. Ready for targeting.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Job title enrichment runs $0.03-0.08 per contact, depending on volume and depth needed. Basic title standardization is lower. Full enrichment with seniority, department, management status, and LinkedIn verification is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why do job titles need standardization?</h3>
          <p>Companies use wildly different titles for similar roles. Without standardization, your filters miss people and routing breaks.</p>

          <h3>What job title fields do you provide?</h3>
          <p>Original title, standardized category, department, seniority level, and management indicator. Enough dimensions to filter however you need.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle creative or ambiguous titles?</h3>
          <p>Context analysis plus human review. "Ninja" at a startup means something different than at an enterprise. Ambiguous titles get verified.</p>

          <h3>Can you update titles that have changed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can refresh against current LinkedIn data to ensure you're targeting based on current roles, not outdated information.</p>
