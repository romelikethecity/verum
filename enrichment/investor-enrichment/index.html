<h2>Investor Enrichment</h2>
<p>Investor enrichment appends investor and board member data to your company records: who invested, which firms are on the board, and what those investors' portfolio patterns suggest about the company's priorities. This data is valuable for sales teams selling to VC-backed companies and for competitive intelligence.</p>

<p>The investor behind a company shapes its strategy. A company backed by a growth equity firm focused on efficiency will behave differently than one backed by an aggressive expansion-stage VC. Knowing who the investors are gives your sales team context about budget, priorities, and decision-making dynamics.</p>

<h2>How We Enrich Investor Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Investor identification.</strong> We identify all known investors for each company using Crunchbase, PitchBook, SEC filings, and press coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Board member mapping.</strong> We identify board members and board observers appointed by investors, who often influence vendor and technology decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Portfolio pattern analysis.</strong> We analyze each investor's portfolio to identify patterns — if they invest in companies using a specific technology, their new portfolio companies likely will too.</li>
    <li><strong>Investor tier classification.</strong> We classify investors by type (angel, seed fund, Series A-C fund, growth equity, PE, corporate venture) and reputation tier.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Investor Enrichment Reveals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>All known investors and investment firms associated with each company</li>
    <li>Board members and board observers identified by their investing firm</li>
    <li>Investor type classification (angel, VC, PE, corporate) for each backer</li>
    <li>Portfolio patterns showing common technology adoption across an investor's companies</li>
</ul>
