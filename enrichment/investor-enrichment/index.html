        <h2>The Hidden Influence</h2>

        <p>You're selling to a Series B startup. You've got a meeting with the VP of Engineering. What you don't know is that their lead investor has a portfolio-wide deal with your competitor. The board is going to push them toward that vendor regardless of your pitch.</p>

        <p>Investor influence on vendor selection is real and often decisive. Tier-1 VCs maintain relationships with preferred vendors. They get portfolio discounts. They hear success stories from other portfolio companies. When a new investment asks "what CRM should we use?" the answer often comes from the investor, not from independent research.</p>

        <p>This works in your favor too. If you already sell to Acme VC's portfolio, you have a warm intro path to every other company they've funded. If you know which VCs actively recommend you, you can prioritize their portfolio companies. If you know which VCs recommend competitors, you can adjust your approach or deprioritize those accounts.</p>

        <p>Beyond vendor influence, investor data reveals company trajectory. Who invested and when tells you whether they're well-funded and growing or scraping by. Board composition hints at strategic priorities. It's context that makes every sales conversation more informed.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Investor identification.</strong> All known investors for each company. Venture firms, angels, corporate investors, PE firms.</li>

          <li><strong>Investment details.</strong> Which rounds each investor participated in, amounts when disclosed, lead vs. follow-on status.</li>

          <li><strong>Board composition.</strong> Who sits on the board. Investor representatives, independent directors, founders. Who influences major decisions.</li>

          <li><strong>Portfolio connections.</strong> Other companies the same investors have funded. Potential reference customers or competitive conflicts.</li>

          <li><strong>Investor contact info.</strong> When available, contact details for relevant partners at the firms. Useful for warm intros.</li>

          <li><strong>Investment timeline.</strong> When each round happened. Recent funding means growth mode. Years since last funding is a different signal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your target accounts.</strong> Company names or domains. We'll match against investor databases.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We pull investment history.</strong> Cross-referencing Crunchbase, PitchBook, SEC filings, press releases, and proprietary sources.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Board and contact research.</strong> Identifying board members and, where available, relevant partner contacts.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Complete investor profiles delivered.</strong> Each company with investors, board members, and portfolio connections. Ready for strategic planning.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Investor enrichment runs $0.15-0.35 per company, depending on depth needed. Basic investor identification is lower. Full profiles with board composition, portfolio mapping, and contact information are higher.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why does knowing investors matter for sales?</h3>
          <p>Investors influence vendor decisions. Many VCs have preferred vendors they recommend. Knowing who invested helps you understand biases and find warm intro paths.</p>
