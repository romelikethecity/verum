        <h2>The Territory Problem</h2>

        <p>Territory assignment runs on location. Simple concept, complicated execution. Your routing rules probably look at the company's address field in Salesforce. But that field is a mess.</p>

        <p>Some records have contact addresses, not company headquarters. The sales rep you talked to works in the Denver office, so Denver is what got entered. But the company is headquartered in Chicago, which is a different territory, with different reps, different pricing, different everything.</p>

        <p>Other records have addresses from years ago. Companies move. The pandemic accelerated this massively. A lot of companies that were in San Francisco in 2019 are now headquartered in Austin or Miami or Denver. Your territory maps don't know because nobody updated the data.</p>

        <p>Then there's the question of what "headquarters" even means. Legal headquarters for tax purposes? Operational headquarters where the CEO sits? The answer matters depending on what you're trying to accomplish.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Primary headquarters address.</strong> Full street address including city, state, zip, and country. Where the company is officially domiciled and typically where executive leadership sits.</li>

          <li><strong>Address normalization.</strong> Consistent formatting so your systems can match and filter. No more "CA" vs "California" vs "Calif." inconsistencies.</li>

          <li><strong>HQ vs branch distinction.</strong> We flag whether an address is the headquarters or a regional office. The rep in Denver might be your contact, but the deal gets credited to Chicago.</li>

          <li><strong>Multiple location mapping.</strong> For companies with dual headquarters or significant regional offices, we identify all major locations.</li>

          <li><strong>Relocation flagging.</strong> Companies that have moved headquarters recently get flagged. Your territory rules should reflect current reality.</li>

          <li><strong>Geocoding.</strong> Latitude and longitude for mapping and distance calculations. Useful for field sales optimization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names, domains, or whatever you have. We'll match against headquarters databases.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We identify headquarters.</strong> Cross-referencing SEC filings, corporate registrations, LinkedIn, and other official sources. Not just whatever address shows up first on Google.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Validation and normalization.</strong> Addresses verified, formatted consistently, and distinguished from branch offices.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: HQ data delivered.</strong> Each company with headquarters address, geocoding, and any flags for moves or dual HQ situations. Ready for territory assignment.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Headquarters enrichment runs $0.05-0.15 per company, depending on whether you need just HQ address or full location mapping with branch offices. Basic HQ identification is lower. Complete location profiles with geocoding and relocation history are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your company list.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you distinguish headquarters from branch offices?</h3>
          <p>We cross-reference SEC filings, corporate registrations, LinkedIn, and other official sources. HQ is where the company is legally domiciled and typically where executives are based.</p>

          <h3>What about companies with multiple headquarters?</h3>
          <p>We identify the primary HQ and flag secondary locations when they exist. Common post-merger or for companies with legal vs operational headquarters in different places.</p>

          <h3>Do you provide full addresses or just city/state?</h3>
          <p>Full street addresses for about 80% of companies. City, state, and country at minimum for the rest.</p>

          <h3>How current is your headquarters data?</h3>
          <p>We track moves and flag relocations. Especially important post-pandemic when many companies changed HQ locations.</p>
