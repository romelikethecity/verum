<h2>Headquarters Enrichment</h2>
<p>Headquarters enrichment identifies and verifies the primary office location for each company in your database. We distinguish headquarters from branch offices, validate addresses against postal records, and append geographic metadata (metro area, county, state, time zone) for territory planning.</p>

<p>Company location data in CRMs is notoriously unreliable. Addresses are entered inconsistently, companies list their registered agent's address instead of their actual office, and relocations go untracked. For territory assignment and geographic targeting, you need accurate HQ data — not whatever was typed into a form three years ago.</p>

<h2>How We Verify Headquarters</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-source verification.</strong> We cross-reference SEC filings, Google Maps, LinkedIn, and company websites to identify the real headquarters location.</li>
    <li><strong>Branch vs HQ classification.</strong> We distinguish headquarters from regional offices, satellite locations, and registered agent addresses.</li>
    <li><strong>Address standardization.</strong> HQ addresses are formatted to USPS standards with ZIP+4, geocoded, and mapped to metro area and county.</li>
    <li><strong>Virtual office detection.</strong> We flag companies using virtual office providers (Regus, WeWork, etc.) so you know when the listed HQ may not be the real operating location.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What HQ-Enriched Records Include</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Verified headquarters address formatted to USPS standards</li>
    <li>Metro area, county, state, and time zone for territory mapping</li>
    <li>HQ confidence level based on source agreement</li>
    <li>Virtual office flag for addresses at known virtual office providers</li>
</ul>
