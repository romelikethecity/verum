<h2>Company Funding Enrichment</h2>
<p>Company funding enrichment adds investment history to your company records: total funding raised, most recent round, round size, investors, and valuation where available. This data helps sales teams prioritize accounts that have recently raised capital and are likely scaling their vendor spend.</p>

<p>A company that raised $50M in Series C last quarter is a very different prospect than one that's been bootstrapped for 10 years. Without funding data, they look identical in your CRM. Funding enrichment separates companies with budget and growth mandates from those that aren't spending.</p>

<h2>How We Enrich Funding Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Funding database matching.</strong> We match your company list against Crunchbase, PitchBook, and other funding databases to find investment history.</li>
    <li><strong>Round-level detail.</strong> For each company, we append every known funding round: date, round type (seed, A, B, etc.), amount raised, and lead investors.</li>
    <li><strong>Recency scoring.</strong> Companies are flagged by how recently they raised — last 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months — since recent funding is the strongest spending signal.</li>
    <li><strong>Investor context.</strong> We identify the lead investors and their portfolio patterns, which can indicate what the company will spend on next.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Funding Enrichment Reveals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Total funding raised and most recent round details for each company</li>
    <li>Round type, amount, date, and lead investors for targeting by growth stage</li>
    <li>Recency flags showing which companies raised in the last 90 days</li>
    <li>Funding stage classification (bootstrapped, seed, early, growth, late, public)</li>
</ul>
