        <h2>The Budget Problem</h2>

        <p>You're reaching out to accounts that look like they should be good fits. Right industry. Right size. Right role. But the deals stall. Turns out they're not buying anything this year because they're conserving cash. Or the budget conversation never happens because there is no budget.</p>

        <p>Funding data changes that. A company that just raised $50M in Series B isn't conserving cash. They're spending it. Aggressively. They have investors expecting growth, board members asking about infrastructure, and a mandate to scale. Your product might be exactly what they need to get there.</p>

        <p>The timing matters too. The best window to reach a recently-funded company is the first few months after the round closes. That's when they're making vendor decisions. That's when the budget is allocated. Wait six months and the money's already committed elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Without funding data, you're flying blind on which accounts have budget and which are just browsing. You're treating the Series C company the same as the company that hasn't raised in five years and is running lean. Same effort, very different close rates.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Funding round type.</strong> Seed, Series A through E, growth equity, debt financing. The round type tells you where they are in their journey and what they're likely prioritizing.</li>

          <li><strong>Amount raised.</strong> Exact dollar amounts when disclosed, ranges when not. A $5M seed is different from a $100M Series C. The amount tells you the scale of spending to expect.</li>

          <li><strong>Funding date.</strong> When the round closed. Recent funding (last 6 months) signals active spending. Older rounds suggest the budget may already be committed.</li>

          <li><strong>Lead investors.</strong> Which firms led the round. Some investors push aggressive tool purchases. Others encourage bootstrapped efficiency. The investor often shapes the spending culture.</li>

          <li><strong>Total funding to date.</strong> Cumulative capital raised across all rounds. Context for understanding the company's overall financial position.</li>

          <li><strong>Valuation (when available).</strong> Post-money valuation for rounds where it's disclosed. Useful for understanding company stage and expectations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your target accounts.</strong> Your current database, a wishlist, or criteria for the accounts you want to research. We work with whatever you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We match against funding databases.</strong> Cross-referencing multiple sources to ensure accuracy and completeness. Press releases, SEC filings, investor announcements, and proprietary data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Funding profiles appended.</strong> Each account gets complete funding history including round types, amounts, dates, and investors.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Prioritization guidance.</strong> We don't just give you data. We help you understand which funding patterns suggest purchase readiness for your specific product.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Funding enrichment runs $0.10-0.25 per account, depending on coverage depth. Basic funding status (funded/not funded) is lower. Complete funding history with investor details is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your target account list.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What funding data do you provide?</h3>
          <p>Round type, amount raised, date, lead investors, total funding to date, and valuation when disclosed. Complete funding history for informed prioritization.</p>

          <h3>How current is the funding data?</h3>
          <p>Near real-time. Most rounds appear within days of announcement. We can also alert you when target accounts raise new rounds.</p>

          <h3>Why does funding data matter for sales?</h3>
          <p>Fresh funding signals budget availability. Recently-funded companies are hiring, building, and buying. They have money to spend and pressure to grow.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify companies that haven't raised funding?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We flag bootstrapped companies and those with no known funding. Sometimes profitable bootstrapped companies are better prospects than cash-burning startups.</p>

        <h2>Ready to Prioritize by Budget?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see the coverage?</strong> Send us a sample of target accounts. We'll show you which ones have recent funding and what their funding history looks like.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to enrich?</strong> Send us your full account list. We'll append funding data so you can prioritize accounts that actually have budget to spend.</p>
