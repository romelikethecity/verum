        <h2>The Email Gap</h2>

        <p>You know who you want to reach. Name, company, title. Maybe you scraped a list from an event. Maybe you built a target account list with specific contacts. What you don't have is their email address.</p>

        <p>Pattern guessing is unreliable. Yes, many companies use firstname.lastname@company.com. But many use first.last@, flastname@, or completely different patterns. And even when you guess the right pattern, you don't know if that specific mailbox exists. The CEO might be ceo@ while everyone else is firstname.lastname@. You're sending emails into the void hoping some land.</p>

        <p>We find emails by actually looking them up. Cross-referencing multiple sources, verifying the mailbox exists, and confirming the person still works there. Not guessing. Finding.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had a list of target contacts but email addresses for only about half. Their SDRs were spending hours researching each contact before outreach. After we found verified emails for the remaining contacts, that research time disappeared. Same targets, faster outreach, more conversations.</p>

        <h2>What You Provide, What We Return</h2>

        <p><strong>You give us:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Person's name (first and last)</li>
          <li>Company name or domain</li>
          <li>Optionally: title, LinkedIn URL, location (improves match rate)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>We return:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Verified email address</li>
          <li>Deliverability status</li>
          <li>Confidence score</li>
          <li>Email pattern used at that company</li>
          <li>Flag if person has changed companies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contact list.</strong> Names and companies in whatever format you have. CSV, spreadsheet, CRM export.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We search multiple sources.</strong> Not just one database. We cross-reference 50+ sources to find email addresses.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Verification before delivery.</strong> Every email checked for deliverability. We catch bounces before they damage your reputation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Verified emails delivered.</strong> Each contact with their email address, confidence score, and delivery status. Ready to use.</p>

        <h2>Why We're Different</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified, not guessed.</strong> We confirm emails exist before delivering. Pattern-matched guesses get you bounces. We get you conversations.</li>

          <li><strong>Multiple sources.</strong> No single database has everyone. We aggregate from 50+ sources for broader coverage and higher accuracy.</li>

          <li><strong>Current employment verified.</strong> We check if the person still works there. Old data means bounced emails.</li>

          <li><strong>Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Common names with multiple matches at the same company. Automated systems guess wrong. We verify.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Email finding runs $0.08-0.20 per contact, depending on volume and difficulty. Standard B2B contacts are lower. Hard-to-find executives or international contacts are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your contact list.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What do you need to find an email address?</h3>
          <p>At minimum, name and company. Additional details like title, LinkedIn URL, or location improve match rates.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from email pattern guessing?</h3>
          <p>Pattern guessing gives you a maybe. We verify emails actually exist and accept mail. Confirmed, not assumed.</p>

          <h3>What's your find rate?</h3>
          <p>70-85% for US-based B2B contacts with name and company. Executives sometimes harder than individual contributors.</p>

          <h3>Can you find emails for people who've changed jobs?</h3>
          <p>We verify current employment. If their job has changed, we find their email at the current company.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Find Those Emails?</h2>
