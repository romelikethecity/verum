<h2>Email Finder</h2>
<p>Our email finder service takes a person's name and company and returns their verified business email address. Unlike email guessing tools that generate a format and hope for the best, we verify every address at the mail server level before returning it. This means lower bounce rates and better deliverability for your outreach.</p>

<p>You found the right person on LinkedIn. You know their name and company. But LinkedIn InMail has a 15% response rate on a good day, and connection requests go ignored. You need their email address. Manual searching takes 5-10 minutes per contact and often fails. At scale, an email finder service is the only practical option.</p>

<h2>How Our Email Finder Works</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Input matching.</strong> You provide the person's name, company name or domain, and optionally their title. We use all available identifiers to find the right person.</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern-based discovery.</strong> We identify the email naming convention at their company and generate the most likely email address based on that pattern.</li>
    <li><strong>Database cross-reference.</strong> We check our multi-source database for known email addresses associated with that person and company combination.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-level verification.</strong> Every candidate email address is verified through SMTP validation to confirm it exists and can receive mail before we return it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Get from Email Finder</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Verified email address for each contact you submit</li>
    <li>Confidence score based on verification method and source quality</li>
    <li>Catch-all domain flag for domains where individual verification isn't possible</li>
    <li>Alternative email suggestions when the primary address can't be verified</li>
</ul>
