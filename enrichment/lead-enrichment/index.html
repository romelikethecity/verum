<h2>Lead Enrichment</h2>
<p>Lead enrichment transforms raw inbound leads into qualified, actionable records by appending company data, contact details, and scoring attributes in real-time or batch. When a lead comes in with just a name and email, enrichment adds company size, industry, technology stack, and seniority level so your team can prioritize and route instantly.</p>

<p>Your forms capture name, email, and maybe company. That's not enough to qualify a lead. Is this a 10-person company or a 10,000-person company? Are they in your target industry? Is this person a decision-maker or a researcher? Without enrichment, your SDRs waste time researching leads that should have been disqualified immediately.</p>

<h2>How We Enrich Leads</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Real-time company identification.</strong> From just an email domain, we identify the company and append full firmographic data: revenue, headcount, industry, and location.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact-level append.</strong> We add job title normalization, seniority level, department, LinkedIn URL, and direct phone number to each lead.</li>
    <li><strong>ICP scoring.</strong> Each enriched lead gets scored against your Ideal Customer Profile criteria so your team immediately sees how well they fit.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate detection.</strong> We check enriched leads against your existing CRM records to flag duplicates and existing customers before they enter the pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Enriched Leads Look Like</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Complete company profile (revenue, headcount, industry, location) from just an email address</li>
    <li>Standardized job title, seniority level, and department for every lead</li>
    <li>ICP fit score for instant qualification and routing</li>
    <li>Duplicate flags showing matches to existing CRM records</li>
</ul>
