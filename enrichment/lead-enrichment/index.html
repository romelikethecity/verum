        <h2>The Form Problem</h2>

        <p>Marketing spent a lot of money getting that person to your website. They read your content, decided you might solve their problem, and filled out a form. What did you capture? Name and email. Maybe company if you asked nicely.</p>

        <p>Now what? Your SDR needs to research this person before calling. Who do they work for? What's their title? Are they even the right buyer? Is this a 50-person company or a 5,000-person company? They spend 10 minutes digging before they can make a single call.</p>

        <p>Multiply that by every lead. If your SDR team handles 100 leads a week, that's over 16 hours of research time. Time they could be spending on actual conversations. And the research is often incomplete because manual googling only gets you so far.</p>

        <p>Lead enrichment happens automatically. A form submission triggers enrichment. By the time the lead hits Salesforce, it's a complete record. Name, title, phone, LinkedIn, company, industry, size, technology stack. Your SDR picks up the phone and starts talking. No research delay.</p>

          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our SDRs spent 2 hours a day researching before. Now they just call."</blockquote>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Contact data.</strong> Full name, job title, direct phone number, mobile when available, LinkedIn profile URL. Everything needed to reach the person.</li>

          <li><strong>Company identification.</strong> Company name, domain, headquarters location. Know exactly who they work for.</li>

          <li><strong>Firmographics.</strong> Industry, employee count, revenue range. Is this a fit for your ICP?</li>

          <li><strong>Technographics.</strong> What tools do they use? CRM, marketing automation, cloud infrastructure. Relevant for positioning.</li>

          <li><strong>Seniority and department.</strong> Are they a decision-maker? Which department owns this problem? Critical for routing and prioritization.</li>

          <li><strong>ICP scoring.</strong> Based on the enriched data, how well do they match your ideal customer profile?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your leads.</strong> Form submissions, webinar registrations, content downloads. Whatever you're collecting.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Quality scoring.</strong> Each lead scored for completeness and ICP fit. You know which ones deserve immediate attention.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enriched leads delivered.</strong> Complete contact and company records ready for your CRM, scoring models, and SDR workflow.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Lead enrichment runs $0.15-0.40 per lead, depending on how many data points you need. Basic contact and company identification is lower. Full profiles with phone, technographics, and ICP scoring are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your lead volume and data requirements.</p>
