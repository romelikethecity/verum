        <h2>What Websites Reveal</h2>

        <p>Websites are remarkably chatty about their underlying technology. Open source in the browser and you see the story. Google Analytics tracking code. HubSpot form handlers. WordPress meta tags. Shopify checkout signatures. CDN headers. The evidence is everywhere.</p>

        <p>This isn't hacking or scraping proprietary data. It's reading what companies publicly broadcast through their websites. Every tracking script, every embedded widget, every framework signature tells you something about their technology stack.</p>

        <p>We systematically decode these signals across hundreds of technologies. The result: a detailed profile of what each company uses for analytics, marketing, content management, e-commerce, and more.</p>

        <h2>What We Detect</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Analytics platforms.</strong> Google Analytics (including GA4 vs Universal), Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap, Hotjar, FullStory, and dozens more.</li>

          <li><strong>Marketing automation.</strong> HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot, Eloqua, ActiveCampaign. Plus live chat tools like Drift, Intercom, and Zendesk.</li>

          <li><strong>CMS platforms.</strong> WordPress, Drupal, Webflow, Contentful, Ghost, Squarespace. The foundation of their content strategy.</li>

          <li><strong>E-commerce platforms.</strong> Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Critical for e-commerce service providers.</li>

          <li><strong>JavaScript frameworks.</strong> React, Vue, Angular, Next.js. Signals technical sophistication and developer preferences.</li>

          <li><strong>Infrastructure signals.</strong> CDNs (Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai), hosting indicators, SSL providers. Technical context.</li>

          <li><strong>Payment processors.</strong> Stripe, PayPal, Braintree signals when visible. Useful for fintech and payment services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Detection Works</h2>

        <p>We scan each website looking for technology signatures:</p>

        <p><strong>Script analysis.</strong> JavaScript files and tracking pixels with identifiable patterns. ga('create', 'UA-...' tells us Google Analytics Universal. gtag() tells us GA4.</p>

        <p><strong>DOM inspection.</strong> HTML elements, class names, and data attributes often reveal the tools that generated them. WordPress themes have recognizable patterns. Shopify checkouts have consistent signatures.</p>

        <p><strong>Header analysis.</strong> HTTP headers reveal CDNs, server software, and caching layers. X-Powered-By, Server, and custom headers provide signals.</p>

        <p><strong>Multiple page scanning.</strong> Homepage alone doesn't tell the whole story. We check key pages to catch technologies only used in specific contexts.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your domain list.</strong> Company websites you want to analyze. Tell us which technology categories matter most.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We scan each website.</strong> Systematic analysis across hundreds of technology signatures.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Technology classification.</strong> Organizing findings by category with confidence indicators.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Technology data delivered.</strong> Each company with detected technologies, organized and ready for segmentation.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Website technology enrichment runs $0.10-0.25 per domain, depending on volume and scan depth. Basic detection across common categories is lower. Comprehensive analysis with all categories and historical tracking is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your technology priorities.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What technologies can you detect?</h3>
          <p>Analytics, marketing tools, CMS, e-commerce, frameworks, CDNs, payment processors. Anything that leaves traces in website code.</p>

          <h3>What about backend technologies?</h3>
          <p>Website scanning reveals frontend and integrated tools. Pure backend systems aren't visible. We're transparent about what we can and can't see.</p>

          <h3>How accurate is detection?</h3>
          <p>85-95% for technologies with clear signatures. Lower for minimal-footprint tools. Confidence levels flagged on every detection.</p>

          <h3>How often should I refresh?</h3>
          <p>Tech stacks change constantly. Quarterly refreshes for active sales campaigns. Annual for general segmentation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to See Their Stack?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to test it?</strong> Send us a sample of domains. We'll scan them and show you what technologies they're running.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to enrich?</strong> Send us your full domain list. We'll return comprehensive technology profiles for targeting and positioning.</p>
