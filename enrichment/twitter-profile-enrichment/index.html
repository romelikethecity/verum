        <h2>The Research Goldmine</h2>

        <p>LinkedIn tells you someone's career history. Twitter tells you what they're thinking about right now. What frustrates them. What excites them. What they're publicly advocating for or against.</p>

        <p>A CEO tweeting about supply chain challenges is more receptive to your logistics solution. A VP of Engineering complaining about CI/CD pipelines is primed for your DevOps tool. A CMO sharing thoughts on attribution is ready for that attribution conversation.</p>

        <p>Not everyone is on Twitter. But the people who are tend to be influential, public-facing, and willing to engage. Executives at tech companies, venture capitalists, journalists and analysts, startup founders, developers and engineers. These audiences have high Twitter adoption.</p>

        <p>If you're selling to them, Twitter profiles are research gold.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified Twitter handles.</strong> Matched to your contact records using bio information, company mentions, and other signals.</li>

          <li><strong>Profile verification.</strong> Common names and ambiguous matches get extra scrutiny. We flag confidence levels so you know which matches are certain.</li>

          <li><strong>Activity indicators.</strong> When someone last tweeted and their approximate posting frequency. Active accounts are more valuable for research than dormant ones.</li>

          <li><strong>Follower context.</strong> Basic follower counts when available. Helps identify influential voices versus casual users.</li>

          <li><strong>No-match flagging.</strong> Clear indication when someone doesn't have a findable Twitter presence. No wasted research time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Twitter Data Matters for Sales</h2>

        <p>Three ways to use Twitter profiles:</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-call research.</strong> Scan recent tweets before a meeting. Know what they're focused on. Reference something they posted. Show you did your homework.</p>

        <p><strong>Trigger-based outreach.</strong> Someone tweets about a problem you solve? That's a warm outreach moment. Better than cold email into the void.</p>

        <p><strong>Personalization at scale.</strong> Build lists based on what people tweet about. Target accounts where executives are publicly discussing relevant topics. Intent data you can see.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contact list.</strong> Names, companies, titles, emails. The more data points, the better the matching.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We search and verify.</strong> Finding Twitter handles and cross-referencing against available signals to ensure accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on ambiguous matches.</strong> John Smith at Acme Corp might have five possible Twitter accounts. We verify which one is actually him.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Twitter data delivered.</strong> Verified handles with confidence indicators and activity flags. Ready for research and outreach.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Who has Twitter profiles worth finding?</h3>
          <p>Tech executives, VCs, journalists, developers, startup founders. High adoption in these segments. Lower in traditional industries.</p>

          <h3>What's your match rate?</h3>
          <p>30-50% for general B2B. Higher (50-70%) for tech execs, VCs, journalists. We'll estimate for your specific audience.</p>

          <h3>Can you tell if someone is active?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We flag last post date and activity level. Active accounts are more valuable for research than dormant ones.</p>

          <h3>How do you verify the right account?</h3>
          <p>Bio, company mentions, profile photos, and cross-referencing. Common names get extra scrutiny. Confidence levels flagged.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Good Fit vs. Not a Good Fit</h2>

        <p>Twitter enrichment works well when you're selling to:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Tech company executives and VCs</li>
          <li>Journalists, analysts, and media professionals</li>
          <li>Developers and engineering leaders</li>
          <li>Startup founders and public-facing executives</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Probably not the right investment if you're targeting:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Traditional industries (manufacturing, construction, etc.)</li>
          <li>Mid-level managers at large enterprises</li>
          <li>Industries where Twitter adoption is low</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Not sure? Send us a sample. We'll estimate match rates and tell you honestly whether this makes sense.</p>
