        <h2>The Research Problem</h2>

        <p>Cold outreach with zero personalization doesn't work. But researching every prospect across multiple social platforms takes forever. Your reps search LinkedIn, check Twitter, maybe look at company blogs. Five minutes per prospect, 50 prospects a day, and half your selling time is gone.</p>

        <p>Having the profile URLs in advance changes everything. Your reps click through, scan for relevant details, and craft personalized messages in a fraction of the time. Or your marketing team uses social data to segment and personalize at scale.</p>

        <p>We find the right profiles across the platforms that matter for your audience. LinkedIn for most B2B. Twitter for executives, journalists, and tech folks. Whatever mix works for your targets.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our SDRs used to spend 2 hours a day just researching. Now they just call."</blockquote>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>LinkedIn profiles.</strong> The primary social platform for B2B. Career history, connections, recent activity. 70-85% coverage for professional audiences.</li>

          <li><strong>Twitter/X profiles.</strong> Especially valuable for executives, thought leaders, journalists, and tech roles. See what they're talking about publicly.</li>

          <li><strong>Additional platforms.</strong> Facebook, Instagram, GitHub, YouTube on request. Coverage and relevance vary by industry and audience.</li>

          <li><strong>Profile verification.</strong> We don't guess. Common names get cross-referenced against company, title, location, and other signals.</li>

          <li><strong>Activity indicators.</strong> Is this profile active or dormant? Useful for deciding which channels to prioritize for outreach.</li>

          <li><strong>No-match flagging.</strong> Contacts without findable social profiles are clearly marked. You know exactly who has profiles and who doesn't.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contact list.</strong> Names, companies, emails, and whatever else you have. Tell us which platforms matter for your use case.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We search and verify.</strong> Finding profiles across your target platforms and verifying matches using multiple signals.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on ambiguous matches.</strong> Common names and unclear matches get manual verification. We don't return wrong profiles.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Social profiles delivered.</strong> Each contact with verified profile URLs for LinkedIn, Twitter, and any other platforms you requested. Ready for research and outreach.</p>
