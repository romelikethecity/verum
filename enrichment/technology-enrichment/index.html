        <h2>Why Technology Data Changes Everything</h2>

        <p>Firmographics tell you who they are. Revenue, employee count, industry. Useful, but incomplete. Two 500-person SaaS companies might have completely different technology needs based on their current stack.</p>

        <p>If you sell a Salesforce integration, you need to know who uses Salesforce. If you compete with HubSpot, you need to know who's running HubSpot. If your product requires AWS, you need to know who's on AWS. This isn't nice-to-have context. It's the difference between relevant outreach and wasted effort.</p>

        <p>Technology enrichment adds this dimension to your targeting. What CRM do they use? What marketing automation? What analytics platform? What cloud infrastructure? Now your segmentation actually means something. Your messaging connects to their reality.</p>

        <h2>What We Detect</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>CRM systems.</strong> Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, Microsoft Dynamics, Pipedrive, Zoho, Freshworks, and more. The first thing most sales teams want to know.</li>

          <li><strong>Marketing automation.</strong> Marketo, Pardot, HubSpot Marketing, Eloqua, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp. Critical for MarTech sellers and agencies.</li>

          <li><strong>Analytics and data tools.</strong> Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Segment, Snowflake signals. Indicates technical sophistication.</li>

          <li><strong>Cloud infrastructure.</strong> AWS, Azure, GCP indicators. Essential for infrastructure, DevOps, and cloud-native tools.</li>

          <li><strong>E-commerce platforms.</strong> Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, BigCommerce. Required intelligence for e-commerce services.</li>

          <li><strong>Category-specific detection.</strong> Tell us what technologies matter for your sales process. We'll prioritize detection for those categories.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Detection Works</h2>

        <p>Technologies leave traces. Website code reveals tracking scripts, form handlers, and embedded widgets. Job postings mention specific tools. DNS records indicate email providers and hosting. Even SSL certificates provide signals.</p>

        <p>We don't rely on one signal. Multiple indicators combined increase confidence in detection accuracy. When we see HubSpot tracking code, HubSpot form handlers, and HubSpot job requirements, we're confident about HubSpot. When we only see one indicator, we flag it as lower confidence.</p>

        <p>Some technologies are highly visible (marketing tools, analytics). Others are harder to detect (backend systems, internal tools). We're transparent about what we can and can't see reliably.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names and domains. Tell us which technology categories matter most for your sales process.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We scan their tech footprint.</strong> Website code, job postings, DNS records, and other signals revealing what they use.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Multi-source verification.</strong> Combining signals for accurate detection. Flagging confidence levels.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Technology data delivered.</strong> Each company with detected technologies organized by category. Ready for segmentation, scoring, and personalized outreach.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Technology enrichment runs $0.10-0.25 per company, depending on volume and detection depth. Basic detection across common categories is lower. Comprehensive analysis with competitor flagging and confidence scoring is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your company list and understanding which technologies you care about.</p>
