        <h2>The Phone Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Your CRM has phone numbers. But look closer. A third of contacts have no number at all. Another third have the company's main line, which gets you a receptionist or phone tree. The remaining third might have direct numbers, but some are years old and the person has moved.</p>

        <p>Your SDRs work around this. They search LinkedIn for phone numbers. They call the main line and try to get transferred. They look up company directories. This research eats hours that should be spent actually talking to prospects.</p>

        <p>Phone enrichment fixes the data itself. We find direct dial numbers, mobile numbers, and verified main lines with extensions. Your reps stop researching and start connecting.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our SDRs used to spend 2 hours a day just researching. Now they just call."</blockquote>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Direct dial numbers.</strong> Office phone lines that ring directly to the person's desk or phone system extension. The best number for B2B outreach.</li>

          <li><strong>Mobile numbers.</strong> Cell phone numbers where available and appropriate. Higher connect rates than office lines.</li>

          <li><strong>Company main line with extension.</strong> When direct dial isn't available, we provide the main number plus the extension that reaches the person.</li>

          <li><strong>Number type labeling.</strong> Every number is labeled: direct, mobile, or main. Your reps know what they're calling before they dial.</li>

          <li><strong>Format standardization.</strong> E.164 international format or whatever your CRM uses. Consistent formatting so validation and parsing work.</li>

          <li><strong>Verification status.</strong> Active number confirmation. We check that numbers are live, not disconnected or reassigned.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contact list.</strong> Names, companies, emails, and whatever phone data you already have. We'll fill gaps and verify existing numbers.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We search for phone numbers.</strong> Direct dials, mobile numbers, and verified main line extensions. Multiple sources for maximum coverage.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Verification.</strong> Numbers checked for active status, correct formatting, and association with the right contact. DNC checking available.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Phone data delivered.</strong> Each contact with all available phone numbers, typed and formatted consistently. Ready for outreach.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Phone number enrichment runs $0.05-0.15 per contact, depending on volume and number types needed. Basic main line lookup is lower. Full enrichment with direct dial, mobile, and verification is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
