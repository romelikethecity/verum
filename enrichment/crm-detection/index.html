<h2>CRM Detection</h2>
<p>CRM detection identifies which customer relationship management platform each company in your database uses: Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics, Zoho, Pipedrive, or one of dozens of others. This technographic data point is critical for companies selling CRM integrations, add-ons, migration services, or competing CRM products.</p>

<p>If you sell a Salesforce integration, pitching a HubSpot shop wastes everyone's time. If you sell CRM migration services, you need to know who's on legacy platforms. Without CRM detection, you're guessing which prospects can actually use your product — and guessing wrong 60-70% of the time.</p>

<h2>How We Detect CRM Platforms</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Website technology scanning.</strong> We scan company websites for CRM-specific tracking scripts, form handlers, and API calls that reveal which platform they use.</li>
    <li><strong>Job posting analysis.</strong> Companies hiring for 'Salesforce Admin' or 'HubSpot Specialist' reveal their CRM choice in job descriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration fingerprinting.</strong> We detect CRM-specific integrations with other tools (email, marketing automation, support) that confirm the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-source validation.</strong> We cross-reference technology detection with job postings and app marketplace data for higher confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What CRM Detection Data Includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>CRM platform identified for each company (Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, Zoho, Pipedrive, etc.)</li>
    <li>Confidence level based on how many detection signals confirmed the finding</li>
    <li>Edition/tier detection where possible (Salesforce Enterprise vs Professional, HubSpot Free vs Enterprise)</li>
    <li>Complementary marketing automation platform detection (Marketo, Pardot, Mailchimp, etc.)</li>
</ul>
