        <h2>The Integration Problem</h2>

        <p>If you sell anything that touches a CRM, you know the first question in every sales conversation: "What CRM are you using?" The answer determines everything. Integration possibilities. Feature relevance. Competitive positioning. Sometimes whether you can even serve them at all.</p>

        <p>Without this information upfront, your outreach is generic. "Our product integrates with all major CRMs" sounds nice but doesn't resonate. "We're the best Salesforce integration in the category" lands better with Salesforce users. It's completely irrelevant to HubSpot shops.</p>

        <p>An ICP analysis we did for a B2B enrichment platform revealed that CRM type was one of the strongest predictors of deal success. Dynamics users had 99% win rates. Pipedrive users had 7%. Same product, dramatically different outcomes based on which CRM the prospect used. Without CRM data, they were wasting equal effort on both segments.</p>

        <p>Knowing the CRM upfront lets you prioritize accounts where you win, skip accounts where you don't, and tailor messaging for each segment. The 10 minutes of research your rep would have done on the call? Do it before the call with enrichment data.</p>

        <h2>CRM Systems We Detect</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Salesforce.</strong> The enterprise standard. Including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and various configurations.</li>

          <li><strong>HubSpot CRM.</strong> Popular with SMB and mid-market. Free tier users and paid editions.</li>

          <li><strong>Microsoft Dynamics.</strong> Common in enterprises, especially those deep in the Microsoft ecosystem.</li>

          <li><strong>Pipedrive.</strong> Sales-focused CRM popular with smaller sales teams.</li>

          <li><strong>Zoho CRM.</strong> Suite-based approach popular internationally and with cost-conscious buyers.</li>

          <li><strong>Other systems.</strong> Freshsales, Monday CRM, Close, Copper, Insightly, and dozens of others. We also flag custom or legacy systems when detectable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Detect</h2>

        <p><strong>Job postings.</strong> Companies hiring "Salesforce Admin" or "HubSpot Specialist" tell you exactly what they use. We scan millions of job listings.</p>

        <p><strong>Website technology.</strong> CRM systems leave traces. Embedded forms, tracking scripts, integration footprints on the website.</p>

        <p><strong>Integration patterns.</strong> What other tools they use often indicates the CRM. Certain marketing automation platforms pair with certain CRMs.</p>

        <p><strong>Proprietary signals.</strong> Sources we don't disclose that provide additional confirmation.</p>

        <p>Multiple signals combined give us confidence. When only one signal exists, we note lower confidence. When we can't detect anything, we mark it unknown rather than guess.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>CRM detection runs $0.05-0.15 per account, depending on volume and whether you need just CRM identification or broader technology stack analysis.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your target account list.</p>
