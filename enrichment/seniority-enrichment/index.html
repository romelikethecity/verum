        <h2>The Authority Problem</h2>

        <p>Not everyone can buy. Your product might require VP-level approval. Your deal size might mean only C-suite can sign. Or maybe you need to identify the technical influencers who will champion your product to executives.</p>

        <p>Job titles alone don't tell you this. "Director" at a 50-person startup might report to the CEO. "Director" at a 50,000-person company might be six levels removed from any real budget authority. "Head of" could mean running a 200-person org or being the only person doing that function.</p>

        <p>Seniority enrichment gives you the classification layer you need. Not just the title, but what it means in context. Executive, VP, Director, Manager, or Individual Contributor. Now your routing works. Your lead scoring works. Your targeting works.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Seniority level classification.</strong> C-Level/Executive, VP, Director, Manager, Individual Contributor. Standard categories that work with any CRM or marketing automation.</li>

          <li><strong>Management indicator.</strong> People manager or individual contributor? A Senior Director who manages 50 people has different authority than a Senior Director who's an individual expert.</li>

          <li><strong>Company context consideration.</strong> We factor in company size and industry. "Director" means different things at different companies.</li>

          <li><strong>Title ambiguity resolution.</strong> "Head of," "Lead," "Principal" get properly classified based on context signals, not keyword matching.</li>

          <li><strong>Original title preserved.</strong> We add seniority classification as a new field. Your original title data stays intact for reference.</li>

          <li><strong>Confidence scores.</strong> Clear indication when classification is certain vs. when title patterns are unusual and classification is our best estimate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contacts.</strong> Names, companies, and job titles. Company size helps with accurate classification if you have it.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We classify each contact.</strong> Analyzing titles in context of company size, industry, and typical org structures.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Ambiguous titles and unusual patterns get manual review. We don't guess.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Seniority data delivered.</strong> Each contact with seniority level, management indicator, and confidence score. Ready for routing and scoring.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Seniority enrichment runs $0.02-0.05 per contact, depending on volume. Basic seniority classification is lower. Full enrichment with management indicator and confidence scoring is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What seniority levels do you classify?</h3>
          <p>C-Level/Executive, VP, Director, Manager, and Individual Contributor. Plus management indicator (people manager vs IC).</p>

          <h3>How do you determine seniority from titles?</h3>
          <p>Full title analysis with company context. "Director" at a 50-person startup differs from "Director" at a Fortune 500. We consider company size and industry norms.</p>

          <h3>What about ambiguous titles?</h3>
          <p>"Head of," "Lead," "Principal" vary by company. We use context signals and flag lower-confidence classifications.</p>

          <h3>Why does seniority matter for sales?</h3>
          <p>Budget authority. Champions can't sign contracts. VPs can. Knowing seniority helps prioritize outreach and route leads correctly.</p>
