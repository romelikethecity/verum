        <h2>Why SIC Still Matters</h2>

        <p>NAICS replaced SIC in 1997. You'd think after 25+ years everyone would have migrated. They haven't.</p>

        <p>SEC filings still use SIC codes. Public company annual reports, 10-Ks, and financial databases reference SIC. If you're doing research on public companies or integrating with financial data sources, you need SIC.</p>

        <p>OSHA and some regulatory databases use SIC. Insurance underwriting often references SIC codes. Many legacy enterprise systems built in the 80s and 90s have SIC baked into their data models and haven't been updated.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you just need both systems. NAICS for modern segmentation, SIC for compatibility. We can provide them simultaneously.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>4-digit SIC codes.</strong> The primary classification used in SEC filings and regulatory databases.</li>

          <li><strong>2-digit major group codes.</strong> The broader industry category. Useful for high-level segmentation.</li>

          <li><strong>Human-readable descriptions.</strong> The code plus what it means. "7372" becomes "7372 - Prepackaged Software."</li>

          <li><strong>Primary and secondary codes.</strong> Companies operating in multiple industries get both primary and secondary classifications.</li>

          <li><strong>NAICS cross-reference.</strong> We can provide the equivalent NAICS code alongside SIC for systems that use both.</li>

          <li><strong>Modern industry mapping.</strong> SIC doesn't cover newer industries well. We map modern companies to the closest appropriate codes and flag approximations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names, domains, and any existing industry data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We classify each company.</strong> Determining appropriate SIC codes based on company activities and products.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Modern industries without exact SIC matches get reviewed to ensure appropriate mapping.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: SIC data delivered.</strong> Each company with 4-digit SIC code, 2-digit major group, and descriptions. Ready for regulatory compliance or legacy system integration.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>SIC code enrichment runs $0.03-0.08 per company, depending on volume. Basic primary code assignment is lower. Full enrichment with secondary codes and NAICS cross-reference is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What's the difference between SIC and NAICS?</h3>
          <p>SIC is older (1937), 4-digit codes. NAICS is newer (1997), 6-digit codes with better modern coverage. SIC is still used for regulatory and financial purposes.</p>

          <h3>Why use SIC instead of NAICS?</h3>
          <p>SEC filings, OSHA data, financial databases, and legacy systems still use SIC. If you're integrating with these systems, you need SIC codes.</p>

          <h3>Do you provide secondary SIC codes?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Companies in multiple industries get primary and secondary codes.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle newer industries?</h3>
          <p>SIC was last updated in 1987. Modern companies get mapped to the closest appropriate code, with notes when classification is approximate.</p>
