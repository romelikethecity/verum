<h2>SIC Code Enrichment</h2>
<p>SIC code enrichment assigns Standard Industrial Classification codes to your company records. While SIC was officially replaced by NAICS in 1997, many business databases, financial systems, insurance platforms, and legacy applications still require SIC codes. We assign accurate 4-digit SIC codes based on each company's actual business activity.</p>

<p>You need SIC codes to run your company data through insurance quoting systems, financial compliance tools, SEC databases, and many B2B data platforms. But SIC codes are rarely included in CRM data, and the system is old enough that many modern business types (SaaS, fintech, social media) don't have intuitive mappings. Automated assignment handles the translation.</p>

<h2>How We Assign SIC Codes</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Business activity classification.</strong> We analyze each company's primary business activity to determine the correct SIC division, major group, and industry code.</li>
    <li><strong>4-digit code assignment.</strong> Each company gets a full 4-digit SIC code (the most specific level) plus 2-digit major group for broader categorization.</li>
    <li><strong>NAICS cross-reference.</strong> We provide NAICS-to-SIC mappings so you can use either system interchangeably.</li>
    <li><strong>Modern business mapping.</strong> For business types that didn't exist when SIC was created (SaaS, cryptocurrency, social media marketing), we apply the most appropriate analogous codes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What SIC-Enriched Data Includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4-digit SIC code with division and major group for each company</li>
    <li>Plain-text industry description for the assigned code</li>
    <li>Corresponding NAICS code for cross-reference</li>
    <li>Primary and secondary codes for diversified companies</li>
</ul>
