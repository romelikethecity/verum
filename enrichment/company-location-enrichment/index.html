        <h2>The Location Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Territory planning should be straightforward. Assign accounts to reps by geography. Cover the map efficiently. Minimize travel, maximize coverage. Easy enough in theory.</p>

        <p>In practice, your location data is a mess. Some accounts show the city where someone filled out a form on their laptop. Others show a Delaware registered agent address when the actual company is in California. Branch offices mixed with headquarters. P.O. boxes instead of street addresses. ZIP codes that don't match the city listed.</p>

        <p>The result? Your West Coast rep thinks they own 500 accounts but half of them make buying decisions in New York. Your field team visits offices where the answer is always "You need to talk to headquarters." Your territory reports are fiction because the underlying geography is wrong.</p>

        <p>A medical device company we worked with had 120,000+ contact records spread across six states. The address data was chaos. Some records showed abbreviated state names, others spelled them out. Branch offices were listed instead of headquarters. Delaware registered addresses appeared for companies that hadn't operated there in years.</p>

        <p>Their territory assignments were essentially guesswork.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Headquarters address.</strong> The actual decision-making location, not a random office or registered agent. Street address, city, state, ZIP code, and country. Verified and standardized.</li>

          <li><strong>Branch office locations.</strong> For multi-location companies, we identify all known offices. Know where they have presence, not just where they're incorporated.</li>

          <li><strong>HQ vs. branch distinction.</strong> Every address flagged as headquarters, regional office, or branch location. Critical for knowing where to focus your efforts.</li>

          <li><strong>Format standardization.</strong> "California" vs "CA" vs "Calif." all normalized to consistent formats. Your data sorts and filters correctly.</li>

          <li><strong>ZIP code validation.</strong> ZIP codes verified against city and state. We catch the mismatches that break geographic queries.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic coordinates.</strong> Latitude and longitude for mapping, distance calculations, and routing. Useful for field sales optimization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your accounts.</strong> Export from your CRM or send a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have, including messy data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze coverage.</strong> Before enriching anything, you'll see exactly what's missing or invalid. Address completeness by field. Records with validation issues.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from multiple sources.</strong> We cross-reference company websites, SEC filings, business registrations, LinkedIn, and proprietary databases. Multiple signals for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA on judgment calls.</strong> Companies with multiple offices. Addresses that could be headquarters or branches. We verify the ambiguous cases before delivery.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Enriched data delivered.</strong> Same format you sent. Complete, standardized location data. Ready to import and use for territory planning.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Company location enrichment runs $0.10-0.25 per account, depending on coverage needs. Basic headquarters address is lower. Full multi-location mapping with branch offices is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What location data do you provide?</h3>
          <p>Headquarters address, office locations, regional presence, and geographic coordinates. We also identify whether each address is HQ, branch, or registered agent.</p>

          <h3>How do you distinguish headquarters from branch offices?</h3>
          <p>We cross-reference SEC filings, company websites, LinkedIn, and business registrations. Multiple sources help identify where decisions actually get made.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify companies with multiple locations?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We flag multi-location companies and can provide all known office addresses. Important for territory planning and avoiding duplicate coverage.</p>

          <h3>What about international company locations?</h3>
          <p>We cover major global markets including UK, Canada, Australia, and Western Europe. Coverage varies by country, generally 80-90% for established markets.</p>
