        <h2>Beyond Company Size and Industry</h2>

        <p>Traditional segmentation uses firmographics: industry, company size, revenue, location. Useful, but incomplete. Two 500-person SaaS companies might have completely different technology needs based on their current stack.</p>

        <p>Technographics adds the technology dimension. What CRM do they use? What marketing automation? What analytics platform? What cloud infrastructure? This context changes everything about how you sell.</p>

        <p>If you sell a Salesforce integration, you need to know who uses Salesforce. If you compete with HubSpot, you need to know who's running HubSpot. If your product requires AWS, you need to know who's on AWS. Technographics makes this targeting possible at scale.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Complete technology profiles.</strong> All detected technologies organized by category: CRM, marketing, analytics, infrastructure, e-commerce, and more.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology adoption patterns.</strong> Are they early adopters running cutting-edge tools? Or conservative with legacy systems? This affects your positioning.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitive technology flags.</strong> Tell us your competitors and we'll flag accounts using them. Prime targets for displacement campaigns.</li>

          <li><strong>Integration opportunity flags.</strong> Tell us what you integrate with and we'll flag accounts using those tools. Natural fit for partnership-led selling.</li>

          <li><strong>Technical sophistication indicators.</strong> Companies running advanced analytics, modern cloud infrastructure, and developer tools are often more receptive to technical products.</li>

          <li><strong>Refresh capability.</strong> Tech stacks change. We can refresh your data quarterly to keep targeting current.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your target account list.</strong> Names and domains. Tell us what technologies are most relevant for your sales process.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We build technology profiles.</strong> Scanning websites, job postings, DNS records, and other signals to detect their stack.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analysis and flagging.</strong> We organize data by category, flag competitors and integration opportunities, and note confidence levels.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Technographic data delivered.</strong> Complete technology profiles for each account, ready for segmentation, scoring, and personalized outreach.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Technographic enrichment runs $0.10-0.25 per company, depending on volume and depth needed. Basic detection across common categories is lower. Comprehensive profiles with competitor flagging and sophistication scoring is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your account list.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What's the difference between technographics and tech stack data?</h3>
          <p>Tech stack is what they use. Technographics is broader — includes tech stack plus adoption patterns, sophistication indicators, and investment signals.</p>

          <h3>How do technographics help with sales?</h3>
          <p>Qualification, positioning, prioritization. Know if they use your competitor, have complementary tools, or are technically sophisticated. Better targeting, higher conversion.</p>

          <h3>Can you tell when companies are evaluating new tech?</h3>
          <p>Sometimes. Job postings, trial activity, new tracking scripts can signal evaluation. Combined with technographics, these intent signals improve timing.</p>

          <h3>How often does technographic data change?</h3>
          <p>Tech stacks evolve. Website changes show up quickly, backend changes take longer. We recommend quarterly refreshes for active sales campaigns.</p>
