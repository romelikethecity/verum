        <h2>The Address Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Your database has addresses. Some of them. Half your records show a city and state but no street address. A quarter have ZIP codes that don't match the city listed. Some show a Delaware registered agent address when the actual company is in Texas.</p>

        <p>For territory planning, this is a disaster. You can't assign accounts to reps by geography when you don't know where the accounts actually are. Shipping workflows fail. Compliance reports are incomplete. Your "West Coast" territory might include companies headquartered on the East Coast because the address field shows where someone filled out a form once.</p>

        <p>A medical device company we worked with had 120,000+ contact records spread across six states. The address data was a mess. Some records showed abbreviated state names, others spelled them out. ZIP codes didn't match cities. Branch offices were listed instead of headquarters.</p>

        <p>Their territory assignments were essentially guesswork.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Complete mailing addresses.</strong> Street address, city, state, ZIP code, country. Not partial data. Complete addresses validated for deliverability.</li>

          <li><strong>Format standardization.</strong> "California" versus "CA" versus "Calif." We normalize to consistent formats so your data sorts and filters correctly.</li>

          <li><strong>ZIP code validation.</strong> ZIP codes that actually match the city and state. We catch and fix the mismatches that break geographic queries.</li>

          <li><strong>Headquarters identification.</strong> The actual decision-making location, not a random branch office or registered agent address. Critical for B2B territory planning.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic coordinates.</strong> Latitude and longitude for mapping and distance calculations. Useful for field sales routing and regional analysis.</li>

          <li><strong>International coverage.</strong> Addresses for major global markets including UK, Canada, Australia, and Western Europe. Standardized to local postal formats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your records.</strong> Export from your CRM, ERP, or send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze coverage gaps.</strong> Before enriching anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Address completeness by field. Records with validation issues.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from multiple sources.</strong> We cross-reference USPS databases, company websites, business registrations, and proprietary sources. Multiple signals for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Companies with multiple locations. Addresses that could be headquarters or branches. We verify before we ship.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Enriched data returned.</strong> Same format you sent, with complete and standardized addresses. Ready to import.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Address enrichment runs $0.10-0.30 per record, depending on coverage needs and whether you need headquarters identification. Basic address completion is at the lower end. Full address plus HQ verification is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
