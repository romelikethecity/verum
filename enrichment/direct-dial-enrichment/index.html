        <h2>The Gatekeeper Problem</h2>

        <p>Cold calling works. But only when you actually reach the person you're calling. The main office number means navigating a phone tree, waiting on hold, getting transferred twice, and eventually landing in a voicemail box that nobody checks.</p>

        <p>A direct dial changes everything. The phone rings on their desk. They pick up. You're talking. No gatekeepers, no waiting, no phone tag. Connect rates jump from 2-3% to 15-20% or higher. The same rep making the same number of calls gets five times more conversations.</p>

        <p>Sales teams know this. That's why reps spend hours each week researching phone numbers before making calls. Checking LinkedIn, company websites, old business cards, anything to find a number that isn't the main switchboard. That research time is expensive.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had their SDRs spending two hours per day on contact research before dialing. After we enriched their database with direct dials, that research time dropped to near zero. Their connect rates more than doubled because they were calling numbers that actually reached people.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified direct dials.</strong> Phone numbers confirmed to ring on your prospect's desk or phone, not the main switchboard. Verified as currently in service.</li>

          <li><strong>Mobile numbers.</strong> When available and appropriate. Mobile numbers often have higher connect rates than desk phones, especially for executives and remote workers.</li>

          <li><strong>Number type flagging.</strong> We tell you if it's a direct line, mobile, or general line. Different types warrant different approaches.</li>

          <li><strong>Format standardization.</strong> Consistent E.164 or your preferred format. No more mixed formats breaking your dialer integrations.</li>

          <li><strong>Verification status.</strong> Each number flagged as verified, likely valid, or unverified. You know what you're working with.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contacts.</strong> Name, company, title, and whatever phone data you have. We'll fill the gaps and verify what exists.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We research and verify.</strong> Cross-referencing multiple sources to find direct lines. Verifying numbers are currently assigned and in service.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Numbers that might be shared lines. Executives with multiple numbers. We verify before delivery.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Direct dials delivered.</strong> Each contact with verified phone numbers, type flags, and confidence scores. Ready to import into your dialer.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Direct dial enrichment runs $0.20-0.50 per contact, depending on difficulty and whether you also need mobile numbers. Standard B2B contacts are at the lower end. Hard-to-find executives are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your contact list.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What's the difference between a direct dial and a main office number?</h3>
          <p>A main office number goes through a switchboard. A direct dial rings on their desk. Connect rates are dramatically higher with direct dials.</p>

          <h3>What's your direct dial coverage rate?</h3>
          <p>60-75% for US-based B2B contacts. Senior executives are harder to find than individual contributors. Coverage varies by industry.</p>

          <h3>How do you verify direct dials?</h3>
          <p>We verify numbers are in service, assigned to the correct person, and actually direct lines. Multiple source verification before delivery.</p>

          <h3>Do you also provide mobile numbers?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Mobile numbers often have higher connect rates, especially for executives and remote workers.</p>
