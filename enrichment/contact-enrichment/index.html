        <h2>The Contact Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Contact data decays fast. Research shows 30% of your contacts will change jobs within a year. Emails stop working. Phone numbers get reassigned. The person you're trying to reach isn't there anymore.</p>

        <p>Even when contacts haven't left, your records are incomplete. A name and company, but no email. An email but no phone. A phone number that goes to the main switchboard instead of their desk. Partial data that requires manual research before every outreach.</p>

        <p>Your SDRs spend hours each week researching contacts instead of reaching them. A study found sales reps spend only 28% of their time actually selling. The rest goes to admin, research, and data entry. Much of that research is hunting for contact information that should already be in your CRM.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had their sales team spending two hours per day researching contacts before making calls. After we enriched their database with verified emails, direct dials, and LinkedIn profiles, that research time dropped to near zero. The same reps were suddenly making twice as many touches per day.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our SDRs spent 2 hours a day researching before. Now they just call."</blockquote>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Enrich</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified email addresses.</strong> Deliverability checked, not just format validated. We confirm the mailbox exists and accepts mail before we give it to you.</li>

          <li><strong>Direct dial phone numbers.</strong> The number that rings on their desk, not the company switchboard. Skip the receptionist and get straight through.</li>

          <li><strong>Mobile numbers.</strong> Higher connect rates than office lines. Increasingly essential as more people work remotely or never sit at a desk.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn profiles.</strong> Verified URLs matched to current employment. LinkedIn often works when email and phone don't.</li>

          <li><strong>Job title and seniority.</strong> Current role, standardized for filtering. Is this person a decision-maker, influencer, or end user?</li>

          <li><strong>Department.</strong> Which team do they work on? Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Finance? Useful for routing and targeting.</li>

          <li><strong>Job change detection.</strong> We flag contacts who've moved companies since your last update. Stop wasting outreach on people who left.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contacts.</strong> Export from your CRM, marketing automation, or send a spreadsheet. Include whatever you have, even if it's just names and companies.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We match and verify.</strong> Cross-referencing 50+ sources to find and verify contact information. Not just one database hit, but multiple signals for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Common names with multiple matches. People with similar roles at the same company. We resolve the ambiguities before delivery.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enriched contacts delivered.</strong> Same format you sent, with all available contact channels filled in. Ready to import and use immediately.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Contact enrichment runs $0.15-0.50 per contact, depending on which fields you need. Email only is lower. Full contact with direct dial, mobile, and LinkedIn is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data and understanding your enrichment priorities.</p>
