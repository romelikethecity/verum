        <h2>The Sizing Problem</h2>

        <p>Your lead scoring model weights company size heavily. It should. A 5,000-person company has different needs, budgets, and buying processes than a 50-person company. Different pricing tiers, different sales motions, different implementation resources required.</p>

        <p>But look at your database. How many companies have accurate employee counts? If you're relying on what reps entered during qualification calls, or what prospects self-reported on forms, the data is probably a mess. "Small business" could mean 5 people or 500 depending on who filled out the field.</p>

        <p>We worked with a data protection company that had 50,000 accounts accumulated over 17 years. Employee count data was missing for about 10% of the database entirely. For the rest, the data was years old. Companies that were 200 employees when first entered had grown to 2,000. Startups had folded. The lead scoring model was making decisions based on fiction.</p>

        <p>After enrichment, they discovered they'd been under-prioritizing accounts that had grown into their enterprise ICP. The segment analysis alone justified the project cost multiple times over.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Exact headcount when available.</strong> Specific numbers for companies where reliable data exists. About 60-70% of B2B companies have exact counts available.</li>

          <li><strong>Employee bands for the rest.</strong> Standard ranges (1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5000+) that work for scoring and segmentation.</li>

          <li><strong>Confidence scores.</strong> How certain we are about each number. Recent SEC filing gives higher confidence than LinkedIn estimates.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth indicators.</strong> Is the company growing, stable, or shrinking? Useful for timing outreach and predicting budget availability.</li>

          <li><strong>Location-specific counts.</strong> Total company size vs. specific office headcount. Matters for territory planning.</li>

          <li><strong>Department breakdown.</strong> When available, estimates by function. Engineering-heavy vs. sales-heavy companies buy differently.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Company names, domains, or whatever identifiers you have. We'll match and enrich.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We cross-reference multiple sources.</strong> LinkedIn, SEC filings, job posting analysis, proprietary databases, and more. No single source has everything.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on outliers.</strong> A company showing 50 employees last quarter and 5,000 this quarter gets flagged for verification. We catch data errors before delivery.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enriched data delivered.</strong> Each company with employee count, band, confidence score, and growth indicator. Ready to import.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Employee count enrichment runs $0.05-0.15 per company, depending on volume and whether you need exact counts or just bands. Basic band classification is lower. Full headcount with growth indicators and department breakdown is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your company list.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How accurate are your employee count estimates?</h3>
          <p>90-95% accuracy by cross-referencing multiple sources. We provide confidence scores so you know how reliable each estimate is.</p>

          <h3>What's the difference between exact headcount and employee bands?</h3>
          <p>Exact headcount is a specific number. Bands are ranges like 201-500. We provide both. Exact counts available for 60-70% of companies.</p>

          <h3>Can you distinguish total company size from specific locations?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can provide total headcount, headquarters count, and location-specific estimates. A 5,000-person company might have only 200 at the office you're targeting.</p>

          <h3>How often does employee count data change?</h3>
          <p>Faster than expected. Growing companies can add 20-30% annually. Layoffs can cut headcount overnight. We recommend quarterly refreshes.</p>
