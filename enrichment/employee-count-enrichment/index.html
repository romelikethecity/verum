<h2>Employee Count Enrichment</h2>
<p>Employee count enrichment appends headcount data to your company records so you can segment by company size. We source employee counts from LinkedIn, HR databases, and public filings, then validate using cross-referencing to provide the most accurate headcount available for each company.</p>

<p>Without employee count, every company in your CRM looks the same size. You can't set up lead scoring rules, assign territories by company size, or focus your reps on accounts big enough to afford your product. Employee count is the most reliable and available sizing metric for B2B companies — more accurate than revenue estimates and easier to verify.</p>

<h2>How We Determine Employee Counts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>LinkedIn analysis.</strong> We pull employee counts from LinkedIn company pages, which reflect how many people currently list that company as their employer.</li>
    <li><strong>Public data cross-reference.</strong> For public companies and large private companies, we cross-reference against SEC filings, annual reports, and public databases.</li>
    <li><strong>Industry adjustment.</strong> LinkedIn undercounts in industries with many non-desk workers. We apply industry-specific adjustments for sectors like healthcare, construction, and retail.</li>
    <li><strong>Historical trend tracking.</strong> We compare current counts against historical data to identify growth or contraction trends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Employee Count Enrichment Provides</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Current employee count estimate for each company</li>
    <li>Size band classification (1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001+)</li>
    <li>Growth trend indicator (growing, stable, declining) based on historical comparison</li>
    <li>Confidence level and primary data source for each estimate</li>
</ul>
