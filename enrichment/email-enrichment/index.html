        <h2>The Email Problem</h2>

        <p>Email is still the primary channel for B2B outreach. But email only works if you have valid addresses. Too many contacts in your CRM have missing, outdated, or incorrect email addresses.</p>

        <p>The problem compounds over time. Email data decays at roughly 2-3% per month. People change jobs, companies rebrand, domains change. That list you built over three years doesn't have the same deliverability it once had. Every campaign, you're damaging your sender reputation on emails that will never arrive.</p>

        <p>Format validation isn't enough. A syntactically correct email address that bounces is worthless. You need deliverability verification. Does the mailbox exist? Does it accept mail? Is it a spam trap? These questions matter more than whether the @ symbol is in the right place.</p>

        <p>A medical device company we worked with had accumulated 120,000+ contacts over years of trade shows, webinars, and content downloads. They knew the data wasn't pristine, but they didn't realize how bad the email decay had gotten.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Email deliverability went from 72% to 94%."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Hansen, Director of Marketing</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified email addresses.</strong> Deliverability checked, not just format validated. We confirm the mailbox exists and accepts mail.</li>

          <li><strong>Personal work emails.</strong> firstname.lastname@ instead of info@ or sales@. Personal addresses have dramatically higher response rates.</li>

          <li><strong>Role-based flagging.</strong> We identify info@, sales@, support@ addresses so you can decide whether to include them. They usually go to shared inboxes.</li>

          <li><strong>Spam trap detection.</strong> Known spam traps flagged before you send. These can get you blacklisted faster than anything else.</li>

          <li><strong>Job change detection.</strong> Contacts who've moved companies get flagged. Their old email won't work. We can provide their new one.</li>

          <li><strong>Confidence scores.</strong> How certain we are about each email. Verified addresses get high confidence. Pattern-matched guesses get lower scores.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contacts.</strong> Name, company, and any existing email addresses you have. We'll find missing emails and verify existing ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We search and verify.</strong> Cross-referencing 50+ sources to find email addresses. Then checking each one for deliverability.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Quality flagging.</strong> Each email categorized: verified, likely valid, risky, or invalid. You decide which confidence levels to use.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enriched data delivered.</strong> Same format you sent. Each contact with verified email and confidence score. Ready to import and use.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Email enrichment runs $0.05-0.15 per contact, depending on whether you need just email finding or full verification with confidence scoring. Volume discounts available for large lists.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
