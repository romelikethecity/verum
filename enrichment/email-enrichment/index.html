<h2>Email Enrichment</h2>
<p>Email enrichment discovers and appends verified business email addresses to your contact records. We find direct email addresses (not generic info@ aliases) using name-to-email pattern matching, domain analysis, and multi-source verification. Every address is validated before delivery so you get emails that reach inboxes, not bounce folders.</p>

<p>Missing email addresses mean contacts you can't reach through digital channels. Your reps resort to cold calling, which has its place, but email lets you scale outreach and nurture over time. The problem is that guessed email formats (first.last@company.com) bounce 15-25% of the time. Verified enrichment reduces that to under 3%.</p>

<h2>How We Find and Verify Emails</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Email pattern detection.</strong> We identify each company's email naming convention (first.last, firstinitial.last, first, etc.) by analyzing known email addresses at that domain.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-source discovery.</strong> Beyond pattern matching, we search professional databases, business registrations, and public records to find email addresses associated with each contact.</li>
    <li><strong>SMTP-level verification.</strong> Every discovered email is verified at the mail server level to confirm the address exists and can receive mail — without actually sending a message.</li>
    <li><strong>Catch-all domain detection.</strong> We identify domains with catch-all configurations (where any address is accepted) and flag these separately since SMTP verification can't confirm individual addresses on catch-all domains.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Email Enrichment Delivers</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Verified business email addresses appended to your contact records</li>
    <li>Verification status for each email (verified, catch-all, unverifiable)</li>
    <li>Email format detected at each company domain for future prospecting</li>
    <li>Bounce risk score so you can decide which emails to include in campaigns</li>
</ul>
