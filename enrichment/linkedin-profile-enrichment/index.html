        <h2>The Research Problem</h2>

        <p>Every outreach works better when you know something about the person. Their career history. Their recent posts. Their connections. LinkedIn has all of this. But first you have to find the right profile.</p>

        <p>For unique names, easy. For "Michael Johnson at Accenture"? There might be forty of them. Your rep searches, scrolls, tries to match title and location, and eventually picks one that looks right. Sometimes they get it wrong. Sometimes they give up and send a generic message.</p>

        <p>This research time adds up. If your SDRs spend even 3 minutes per contact finding LinkedIn profiles, that's 2.5 hours per day at 50 contacts. Time they could spend actually talking to prospects.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our SDRs used to spend 2 hours a day just researching. Now they just call."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Norullah, Sales Manager</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified LinkedIn profile URLs.</strong> Direct links to the correct profile for each contact. No more searching and hoping you found the right one.</li>

          <li><strong>Common name handling.</strong> We don't guess on "Jennifer Smith at IBM." We verify using email domain, title, location, and career history to ensure accuracy.</li>

          <li><strong>Career history data.</strong> Previous companies and roles when available. Useful for personalization and finding warm intro paths.</li>

          <li><strong>Mutual connection insights.</strong> See if you have shared connections who could facilitate introductions.</li>

          <li><strong>Profile photo availability.</strong> Helpful for matching faces at events or verifying you have the right person.</li>

          <li><strong>No-match flagging.</strong> Contacts without LinkedIn profiles get flagged clearly. You'll know who has profiles and who doesn't.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contact list.</strong> Names, companies, and whatever else you have. Emails and titles help with matching common names.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We find and verify profiles.</strong> Searching across LinkedIn and cross-referencing to ensure accurate matches. Common names get extra verification.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on ambiguous matches.</strong> When multiple profiles could match, we verify manually. No guessing.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Profiles delivered.</strong> Each contact with LinkedIn URL and any additional profile data you requested. Ready for research and outreach.</p>

          <h3>What about contacts not on LinkedIn?</h3>
          <p>We flag them clearly as "no profile found." You'll know exactly which contacts have verified profiles.</p>
