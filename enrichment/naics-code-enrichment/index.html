        <h2>Why NAICS Codes Matter</h2>

        <p>Industry data is supposed to help you segment and target. But when your industry field is freeform text entered by different people at different times from different sources, it doesn't help much.</p>

        <p>You want to target healthcare companies. So you filter by "Healthcare." But you miss "Medical," "Health Services," "Hospital," "Pharma," "Life Sciences," and the dozen other variations people used. Some healthcare companies are labeled "Technology" because they make medical software. Your segment is incomplete.</p>

        <p>NAICS codes solve this. They're the official US government classification system. Every industry has a specific code. Healthcare and Social Assistance is sector 62. Hospitals specifically are 622. General Medical and Surgical Hospitals are 622110. When you filter by code, you catch everything.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We found segments we'd completely ignored."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Frédéric, Revenue Operations</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Full 6-digit NAICS codes.</strong> The most specific classification level. 541511 (Custom Computer Programming Services) is different from 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services).</li>

          <li><strong>Hierarchical parent codes.</strong> 2-digit sector, 3-digit subsector, 4-digit industry group, 5-digit industry. Filter at whatever level you need.</li>

          <li><strong>Human-readable descriptions.</strong> The code plus what it means. "541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services" is useful. "541511" alone requires a lookup.</li>

          <li><strong>Primary and secondary codes.</strong> For companies operating across industries, we can provide both primary (main revenue source) and secondary classifications.</li>

          <li><strong>2022 NAICS version.</strong> We use the current NAICS classification, updated in 2022. Not outdated codes from previous revisions.</li>

          <li><strong>Standardization of existing data.</strong> If you have messy industry data, we'll clean it and map to proper NAICS codes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names, domains, and whatever industry data you currently have (even if it's messy).</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We classify each company.</strong> Analyzing company activities, products, and services to determine the appropriate NAICS code.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Companies in emerging industries or spanning multiple sectors get manual review for accurate classification.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: NAICS data delivered.</strong> Each company with full NAICS code hierarchy and descriptions. Ready for segmentation.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>NAICS code enrichment runs $0.03-0.08 per company, depending on volume. Basic primary code assignment is lower. Full hierarchy with secondary codes is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What is a NAICS code?</h3>
          <p>North American Industry Classification System. The standard used by US, Canada, and Mexico to classify businesses. 6-digit hierarchical codes from broad sector to specific industry.</p>

          <h3>Why use NAICS instead of freeform industry fields?</h3>
          <p>Standardization. "Tech" and "Technology" and "Software" mean different things to different people. NAICS 541511 always means the same thing. Your filters work.</p>

          <h3>Do you provide the full 6-digit code?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Full 6-digit plus all parent codes (2-digit sector through 5-digit industry). Filter at whatever level you need.</p>

          <h3>What about companies in multiple industries?</h3>
          <p>We assign primary NAICS based on main revenue activity. Secondary codes available when a company has significant operations across industries.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Standardize Your Industry Data?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see the problem?</strong> Send us a sample. We'll show you how many unique industry values you have and how they map to NAICS codes.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to classify?</strong> Send us your company list. We'll return standardized NAICS codes so your segmentation actually works.</p>
