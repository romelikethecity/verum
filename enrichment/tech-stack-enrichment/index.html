        <h2>The Context Problem</h2>

        <p>Your pitch changes based on their stack. If they're using a competitor, you position against it. If they're using something you integrate with, you lead with that. If they have no solution in your category, that's a different conversation entirely.</p>

        <p>Without tech stack data, every conversation starts from scratch. Your reps ask discovery questions that could have been answered before the call. Your campaigns go to everyone instead of the segments most likely to buy. Your competitive intel is limited to what prospects volunteer.</p>

        <p>Tech stack enrichment gives you this context at scale. Before you reach out, you know what they're running. Your messaging is relevant from the first touch.</p>

        <h2>What We Detect</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>CRM systems.</strong> Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, Pipedrive, Zoho, Freshworks, and more. Often the first thing sales teams want to know.</li>

          <li><strong>Marketing automation.</strong> Marketo, Pardot, HubSpot Marketing, Eloqua, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp. Critical for MarTech sellers.</li>

          <li><strong>Analytics and data.</strong> Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Segment, Snowflake signals. Shows technical sophistication.</li>

          <li><strong>Cloud infrastructure.</strong> AWS, Azure, GCP indicators. Helpful for infrastructure and DevOps tools.</li>

          <li><strong>E-commerce platforms.</strong> Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, BigCommerce. Essential for e-commerce tools and services.</li>

          <li><strong>Category-specific detection.</strong> Tell us what technologies matter for your sales process and we'll prioritize detection for those categories.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names and domains. Tell us which technology categories matter most for your sales process.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We scan their tech footprint.</strong> Website code, job postings, DNS records, and other signals revealing what they use.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Multi-source verification.</strong> We don't rely on one signal. Multiple indicators increase confidence in detection accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Tech stack data delivered.</strong> Each company with detected technologies organized by category, with confidence levels. Ready for segmentation and personalization.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Tech stack enrichment runs $0.10-0.25 per company, depending on volume and detection depth. Basic detection across common categories is lower. Comprehensive analysis with multiple categories and confidence scoring is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your company list.</p>
