        <h2>The Right Tool for Specific Jobs</h2>

        <p>Let's be direct: for most B2B prospecting, LinkedIn is the better platform. Executives, enterprise buyers, and technical decision-makers live there professionally. If that's your audience, start with LinkedIn enrichment.</p>

        <p>But Facebook still matters for certain audiences. Real estate agents maintain business pages religiously. Local service providers build community through Facebook groups. Small business owners in traditional industries often have stronger Facebook presence than LinkedIn presence. D2C brand founders are active where their customers are.</p>

        <p>If you're selling to these segments, Facebook profiles provide research context you can't get elsewhere. Their community engagement, customer interactions, how they present their business publicly. Different data than LinkedIn, and for the right use cases, more valuable.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Personal profile matching.</strong> Find the individual's Facebook presence when you need to understand them as a person, not just a professional.</li>

          <li><strong>Business page discovery.</strong> Find company pages for customer engagement analysis, content strategy research, and competitive intelligence.</li>

          <li><strong>Profile verification.</strong> We don't guess. Name, company, location cross-referencing to ensure correct matches. Confidence flags on ambiguous cases.</li>

          <li><strong>Activity indicators.</strong> Is this an active profile or dormant? Last post date, engagement levels. Helps you prioritize which profiles are worth researching.</li>

          <li><strong>No-match flagging.</strong> When someone doesn't have a findable Facebook presence, we tell you. No wasted time searching for profiles that don't exist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contact list.</strong> Names, companies, and whatever else you have. Tell us if you need personal profiles, business pages, or both.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We search and verify.</strong> Finding potential matches and cross-referencing against available signals.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Human QA on matches.</strong> Common names and ambiguous cases get manual verification. We'd rather return "no match" than a wrong profile.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Facebook data delivered.</strong> Verified profile URLs with confidence indicators. Ready for research and outreach planning.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Facebook profile enrichment runs $0.05-0.15 per contact, depending on volume and whether you need personal profiles, business pages, or both. Match rates are lower than LinkedIn, so we price accordingly.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you an honest coverage estimate after seeing your target audience.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Is Facebook still relevant for B2B?</h3>
          <p>For most B2B, LinkedIn is primary. But Facebook matters for real estate, local services, small business owners, and D2C. Right tool for the right job.</p>

          <h3>What's your match rate?</h3>
          <p>30-50% typically, lower than LinkedIn. Many professionals keep Facebook personal. We're upfront about this before you commit.</p>

          <h3>Personal profiles or business pages?</h3>
          <p>Either or both. Personal profiles for individual research. Business pages for company analysis. Tell us what you need.</p>

          <h3>How do you verify matches?</h3>
          <p>Name, company, location cross-referencing. Common names get extra scrutiny. We flag confidence levels so you know which matches are certain.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Is This Right for You?</h2>

        <p>Facebook profile enrichment makes sense if:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Your targets are in real estate, local services, or small business</li>
          <li>You're doing D2C or influencer marketing outreach</li>
          <li>You want to understand community engagement and customer interactions</li>
          <li>LinkedIn data already exists and you want additional social context</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It probably doesn't make sense if:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Your targets are enterprise buyers or technical decision-makers</li>
          <li>You don't already have LinkedIn data (start there first)</li>
          <li>You need high match rates for broad prospecting campaigns</li>
        </ul>
