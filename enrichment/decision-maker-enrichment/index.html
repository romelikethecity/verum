        <h2>The Wrong-Contact Problem</h2>

        <p>Your CRM is full of contacts. Marketing captured them from webinars, content downloads, trade shows. But how many of them can actually buy? Not influence. Not evaluate. Actually sign a purchase order.</p>

        <p>Most contacts in most CRMs are influencers at best. Individual contributors who might use your product. Managers who might recommend it. But when it comes to budget authority, they'll tell you "I need to run this by my VP" or "Let me check with finance." The real decision maker isn't in your database.</p>

        <p>Selling to the wrong person is worse than not selling at all. You invest time, resources, and pipeline capacity into deals that stall at the budget conversation. Your champion loves you but can't move the organization. Meanwhile, the actual decision maker doesn't know you exist.</p>

        <p>The solution isn't more contacts. It's the right contacts. People with budget authority for what you sell, at the companies you're targeting, with contact information that lets you reach them directly.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Decision maker identification.</strong> Not just title matching. We analyze seniority, department, company structure, and budget patterns to find who actually controls purchasing decisions for your category.</li>

          <li><strong>Purchase-type targeting.</strong> The decision maker for software is different from the decision maker for services. Tell us what you sell, we'll find who buys it.</li>

          <li><strong>Full contact details.</strong> Verified email, direct dial, mobile when available, LinkedIn profile. Multiple channels to reach them.</li>

          <li><strong>Buying committee mapping.</strong> For complex sales, you need the committee, not just one person. We identify economic buyers, technical evaluators, and executive sponsors when relevant.</li>

          <li><strong>Company context.</strong> How big is the company? How is it structured? Who reports to whom? Context that helps you navigate the organization.</li>

          <li><strong>Budget authority indicators.</strong> Signals that suggest this person controls spend: their title relative to company size, their tenure, their department's role in purchasing decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Tell us what you sell.</strong> What type of purchase is this? Marketing software? Professional services? IT infrastructure? The category determines who we look for.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Send us your target accounts.</strong> The companies you want to sell to. We'll find the decision makers at each one.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: We research and verify.</strong> Cross-referencing organizational data, job postings, LinkedIn, and proprietary sources to identify and verify the right contacts.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Decision makers delivered.</strong> Complete profiles with contact information. Not just names and titles, but people you can actually reach who can actually buy.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Decision maker enrichment runs $1.00-3.00 per contact, depending on how specific your requirements are and how difficult the contacts are to find. Basic decision maker identification is lower. Full buying committee mapping with all contact channels is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your target accounts and requirements.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you identify decision makers versus influencers?</h3>
          <p>We analyze title, seniority, department, and company structure. Context matters. A VP at a 50-person company has different authority than the same title at 5,000 employees.</p>

          <h3>Can you find decision makers for specific purchase types?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Different purchases have different decision makers. Tell us what you sell, we'll find who controls that budget.</p>

          <h3>What contact information do you provide?</h3>
          <p>Verified email, direct dial, mobile when available, and LinkedIn profile. Multiple channels to reach them.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle committee decisions?</h3>
          <p>We can map the full buying committee including economic buyers, technical evaluators, and executive sponsors. Not just one contact.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Reach the Real Buyers?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to test our targeting?</strong> Send us a few accounts where you know the decision maker. We'll identify them independently so you can validate our accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to build your decision maker list?</strong> Tell us what you sell and who you're targeting. We'll find the people who can actually say yes.</p>
