<h2>Decision Maker Enrichment</h2>
<p>Decision-maker enrichment identifies and appends contact information for the people who make purchasing decisions at your target accounts. We find the right contacts by role and seniority — not just anyone at the company, but the specific titles that match your buyer personas.</p>

<p>Selling to companies means selling to people, and the wrong person can't buy. Most databases have contacts, but not decision-makers. Your rep spends three weeks nurturing a manager who has to 'check with their boss.' Decision-maker enrichment puts your team in front of buyers, not influencers.</p>

<h2>How We Find Decision-Makers</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Buyer persona mapping.</strong> We define which titles and roles are your primary decision-makers, influencers, and champions based on your sales process and ICP.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact identification.</strong> For each target account, we identify people matching your buyer personas using LinkedIn, company websites, and organizational databases.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact verification.</strong> Each identified decision-maker gets verified: is this person still in this role at this company with a working email and phone number?</li>
    <li><strong>Buying committee mapping.</strong> Where possible, we identify multiple stakeholders per account to map the full buying committee, not just one contact.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Decision-Maker Enrichment Delivers</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Named contacts matching your buyer personas at each target account</li>
    <li>Verified direct email addresses and phone numbers for each decision-maker</li>
    <li>Title, department, and seniority classification for every contact</li>
    <li>Buying committee context showing multiple stakeholders per account where identified</li>
</ul>
