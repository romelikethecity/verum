        <h2>The Timing Problem</h2>

        <p>By the time a prospect fills out your demo form, they've already done 70% of their research. They've read reviews, compared vendors, talked to peers. Your sales conversation starts late in their process.</p>

        <p>Intent data flips that. Instead of waiting for prospects to identify themselves, you identify them when they start researching. Someone at Acme Corp is reading CRM comparison articles, visiting your competitors' pricing pages, and downloading analyst reports. That's a buying signal, even if they never touched your website.</p>

        <p>The challenge is connecting these anonymous research signals to actual accounts you can target. Random topics don't help. You need to know which specific companies are researching solutions in your category, how intense their research is, and how recently it happened.</p>

        <p>We've seen teams restructure their entire ABM approach around intent. Instead of targeting accounts based on firmographics alone, they prioritize accounts showing active research behavior. Same budget, better allocation, more pipeline.</p>

        <h2>Intent Signals We Track</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Topic research patterns.</strong> Content consumption on topics relevant to your product. Not just one article, but sustained research indicating genuine interest.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitive research.</strong> Visits to competitor websites, product pages, and pricing pages. If they're evaluating your competitors, they might evaluate you too.</li>

          <li><strong>Review site activity.</strong> Engagement with G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, and other review platforms. Reading reviews often signals active vendor evaluation.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology change signals.</strong> Job postings for tools you replace, complaints about current vendors, contract renewal timing. Indicators that change is coming.</li>

          <li><strong>Surge detection.</strong> When research intensity spikes at a company. Normal background research is different from suddenly consuming 10x the usual content.</li>

          <li><strong>Recency scoring.</strong> When the research happened. Last week's signals are more actionable than last quarter's.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Define your intent topics.</strong> What should we track? Product categories, competitor names, pain points you solve. We configure monitoring around your market.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Match to your target accounts.</strong> Send us your account list. We'll identify which ones are showing intent signals for your topics.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Intent scoring.</strong> Not all signals are equal. We score accounts based on signal strength, recency, and relevance to your specific offering.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Prioritized lists delivered.</strong> Accounts ranked by intent score with signal details. Your team knows exactly who to focus on and why.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Intent data enrichment runs $0.15-0.40 per account, depending on how many topics you're tracking and how deep you need the signal analysis. Basic intent flagging is lower. Detailed signal breakdowns with competitive intelligence are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your target accounts and topics.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What is intent data?</h3>
          <p>Digital behavior that suggests buying interest. Content consumption, competitor research, review site visits. Aggregated across thousands of sites to identify companies researching your category.</p>

          <h3>How does this differ from website visitor tracking?</h3>
          <p>Website data shows who visited you. Intent data shows who's researching your category everywhere else. The market researching elsewhere is 50x larger than your website traffic.</p>

          <h3>What intent signals do you track?</h3>
          <p>Topic research, competitive research, review site activity, technology change signals, and surge detection. With recency scoring so you prioritize fresh signals.</p>

          <h3>How fresh is intent data?</h3>
          <p>Intent signals decay fast. We provide recency scoring so you focus on accounts with recent activity, not stale research from months ago.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Find In-Market Accounts?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Want to see who's researching?</strong> Send us your target account list and topics. We'll show you which accounts are showing intent signals right now.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to prioritize by intent?</strong> Send us your full account database. We'll score and rank by intent so your team focuses on the right accounts.</p>
