<h2>Intent Data Enrichment</h2>
<p>Intent data enrichment identifies which companies on your target account list are actively researching topics related to your product or service. We aggregate research activity signals from content consumption, search behavior, and review site visits to score accounts by their likelihood of being in an active buying cycle.</p>

<p>Without intent signals, outbound outreach is a volume game — contact enough accounts and some will happen to be in-market. Intent data flips this from random to targeted. Teams using intent data report 2-3x higher conversion rates because they're reaching companies during active evaluation, not interrupting companies with no current need.</p>

<h2>How We Add Intent Signals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Topic taxonomy definition.</strong> We define the topics that indicate purchase intent for your product: category keywords, competitor names, and problem-related terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Signal aggregation.</strong> We match your account list against multiple intent data providers to identify companies showing above-baseline research activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Surge detection.</strong> Accounts get scored by how much their research activity exceeds their normal baseline — separating genuine buying signals from routine browsing.</li>
    <li><strong>Competitive intent identification.</strong> We flag accounts researching your competitors specifically, which indicates active vendor evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Intent Data Enrichment Shows</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Intent scores for each account based on topic research activity</li>
    <li>Specific topics being researched at each company for personalized outreach</li>
    <li>Surge indicators showing whether intent is increasing, stable, or declining</li>
    <li>Competitive intent flags showing which accounts are evaluating competitors</li>
</ul>
