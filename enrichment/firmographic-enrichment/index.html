        <h2>The Foundation Problem</h2>

        <p>Firmographics are supposed to be the easy part. Company size, industry, location. Basic stuff. But look at your actual database. Industry fields are blank or inconsistent. Employee counts are years old. Revenue ranges are guesses. Half your accounts are missing the data needed for even basic segmentation.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had 50,000 accounts accumulated over 17 years. Industry classification was missing for thousands of records. When it existed, it was inconsistent. Same industry described a dozen different ways. The team couldn't answer a simple question like "how many financial services companies are in our database" without hours of manual work.</p>

        <p>After firmographic enrichment, they achieved 98.6% coverage on industry classification. They discovered 703 MSP accounts buried in generic categories worth an estimated $875K in ARR potential. Companies they'd been ignoring because they couldn't segment properly.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We found segments we'd completely ignored."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Frédéric, Revenue Operations</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> NAICS codes, SIC codes, or custom taxonomies. Standardized so your filtering actually works. No more "Software" vs "Technology" vs "SaaS" inconsistency.</li>

          <li><strong>Employee count.</strong> Exact headcount when available, reliable bands when not. Updated regularly since companies grow and shrink faster than you'd expect.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue estimates.</strong> Annual revenue ranges based on employee count, industry benchmarks, and available financial data. 80-90% accuracy on estimates.</li>

          <li><strong>Headquarters location.</strong> Full address with city, state, country. Distinguished from branch offices. Critical for territory assignment.</li>

          <li><strong>Company type.</strong> Public, private, nonprofit, government. Different types buy differently and have different budget cycles.</li>

          <li><strong>Corporate structure.</strong> Parent companies and subsidiaries mapped. Know who actually owns what before you pitch.</li>

          <li><strong>Year founded.</strong> Startups act differently than 50-year-old companies. Age often correlates with budget cycles and tech adoption patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Social profiles.</strong> LinkedIn company page, Twitter handle, and other social presence. Additional context and research starting points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your company list.</strong> Names, domains, or whatever identifiers you have. We'll match against our databases.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We match and enrich.</strong> Cross-referencing 50+ sources to build complete profiles. No single source has everything, so we aggregate.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Standardization.</strong> Industries mapped to consistent taxonomies. Locations normalized. Employee counts validated. Your data becomes usable.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Complete profiles delivered.</strong> Each company with all available firmographic data, confidence scores, and data freshness indicators. Ready for segmentation.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Firmographic enrichment runs $0.10-0.25 per company, depending on how many data points you need. Basic firmographics (industry, size, location) are lower. Full profiles with revenue estimates, corporate structure, and growth indicators are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your data and requirements.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What firmographic data points do you provide?</h3>
          <p>Industry classification, employee count, revenue range, headquarters location, year founded, company type, parent/subsidiary relationships, and social profiles. Basically everything you need to understand and segment a company.</p>

          <h3>What's your match rate?</h3>
          <p>85-95% on basic firmographics for US companies with valid domains. More specialized data like revenue estimates runs 60-80%.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle companies with multiple locations?</h3>
          <p>We distinguish headquarters from branch offices. You get the HQ address plus we can flag where each contact actually works.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify parent companies and subsidiaries?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We map corporate structure so you see the full picture. Important for enterprise deals where you're talking to subsidiaries.</p>
