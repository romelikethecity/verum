        <h2>The Connect Rate Problem</h2>

        <p>Office direct lines used to work. Someone would answer, or you'd leave a voicemail they'd actually check. That world is mostly gone.</p>

        <p>Remote work changed everything. Many "direct lines" now route to empty desks. Voicemail boxes fill up and get ignored. When people do work in offices, they're screening calls. The main line gatekeeper problem is worse than ever.</p>

        <p>Mobile changes the equation. People answer their cell phones. Not always, but way more often than office lines. A mobile number is often the only way to actually reach someone. Your SDRs know this. They spend time trying to find mobile numbers on their own. We can do it faster and at scale.</p>

          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our SDRs used to spend 2 hours a day just researching. Now they just call."</blockquote>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified mobile numbers.</strong> Cell phone numbers confirmed as active mobile lines, not landlines or VOIP mislabeled as mobile.</li>

          <li><strong>Line type verification.</strong> We confirm each number is actually a mobile line using carrier lookup, not just formatted like one.</li>

          <li><strong>DNC registry checking.</strong> Numbers checked against Do Not Call registries. Flagged appropriately so you can filter as needed.</li>

          <li><strong>Carrier information.</strong> Know which carrier serves each number. Useful for SMS delivery optimization.</li>

          <li><strong>Recently ported flags.</strong> Numbers that recently changed carriers or owners get flagged for extra verification.</li>

          <li><strong>No-match transparency.</strong> Contacts without available mobile numbers are clearly marked. You'll know exactly what coverage you have.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your contact list.</strong> Names, companies, and whatever else you have. Email addresses help with matching.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We search for mobile numbers.</strong> Cross-referencing multiple data sources to find cell phone numbers associated with each contact.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Verification.</strong> Every number checked for line type, carrier status, and DNC registry presence.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Mobile data delivered.</strong> Each contact with mobile number (where available), line type verification, and compliance flags. Ready for outreach.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Mobile number enrichment runs $0.08-0.20 per contact, depending on volume and verification depth. Basic mobile lookup is lower. Full verification with carrier info and DNC checking is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you source mobile numbers compliantly?</h3>
          <p>Public business directories, professional networks, and commercial data providers. We check DNC registries and flag restricted numbers. Compliance as the caller is on you, but we give you the data.</p>

          <h3>What's the difference between mobile and direct dial?</h3>
          <p>Direct dials include any phone reaching the person directly — office, mobile, home. Mobile enrichment specifically finds cell numbers, which have higher answer rates.</p>

          <h3>What's your coverage rate?</h3>
          <p>Typically 40-60% for B2B contacts. Executives and sales roles have higher coverage. Technical roles and some industries have lower availability.</p>

          <h3>Do you verify numbers are active?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Carrier lookup and line type verification confirm active mobile status. Recently ported or disconnected numbers are flagged.</p>
