# Verum Pricing Strategy

## Positioning

Verum is positioned as a **done-for-you service**, not a self-serve SaaS platform. This means:

- Higher per-record pricing is justified (paying for labor + data)
- Lower commitment (no annual contracts)
- Faster time-to-value (no learning curve)
- Human quality control as a differentiator

## Pricing Tiers

### Starter - $500 (starting price)
- Up to 5,000 records
- Data cleaning OR enrichment (not both)
- Email validation included
- CSV delivery
- 48-hour turnaround
- Email support

**Target:** Small teams testing the service, one-time cleanups

### Growth - $2,500 (starting price)
- Up to 50,000 records
- Data cleaning + enrichment
- 50+ enrichment sources
- CRM-ready formatting
- 24-hour turnaround
- Priority support
- Dedicated project manager

**Target:** Mid-market companies with serious data needs

### Enterprise - Custom pricing
- Unlimited records
- Full service suite
- Custom enrichment rules
- Direct CRM integration
- Same-day turnaround
- Dedicated account manager
- Monthly data hygiene
- Custom reporting

**Target:** Large teams with ongoing data needs

## Per-Record Pricing

| Service | Price Range | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Data Cleaning | $0.02-0.05/record | Dedup, validation, standardization |
| Data Enrichment | $0.10-0.50/record | Depends on fields needed |
| Data Analysis | $1,500+/project | ICP, segmentation, market analysis |

### What Affects Per-Record Price

**Cleaning:**
- Complexity of deduplication rules
- Number of fields to standardize
- Email validation (adds cost)
- Match rate requirements

**Enrichment:**
- Number of fields to enrich
- Type of data (contact vs. company)
- Match rate expectations
- Data sources required

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Model | Starting Price | Annual Contract |
|------------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| ZoomInfo | Enterprise SaaS | $15,000/year | Yes (required) |
| Clearbit | Credits (HubSpot) | $50/month | Optional |
| Apollo.io | Freemium SaaS | $49/month | Optional |
| Lusha | Credits per user | $99/month | Optional |
| **Verum** | Done-for-you service | $500/project | No |

### Why Verum Wins

vs. **ZoomInfo:**
- 30x lower entry point ($500 vs $15K)
- No annual contract
- Service-based (no learning curve)

vs. **Clearbit/Apollo/Lusha:**
- We do the work (not DIY)
- Human quality control
- Data cleaning included (they don't offer it)
- No software to manage

## Pricing Psychology

### $500 Starter
- Below most procurement thresholds
- Low-risk way to test
- Gets foot in the door
- Easy to expense on a credit card

### $2,500 Growth
- Sweet spot for mid-market
- Cheaper than hiring a contractor
- Faster than doing it in-house
- Signals "professional service"

### Custom Enterprise
- Room to negotiate
- Volume discounts available
- Shows flexibility
- Allows for complex requirements

## Margin Considerations

**Watch your margins on:**
- Small projects (<$500) - time spent may not be worth it
- Complex enrichment - API costs can add up
- Rush jobs - may need to charge premium

**Recommended minimums:**
- Cleaning: $0.02/record minimum
- Enrichment: $0.10/record minimum
- Analysis: $1,500/project minimum

## Upsell Paths

1. **Starter → Growth:** "Now that you've seen the quality, let's do your full database"
2. **One-time → Recurring:** "Set up monthly hygiene to keep data clean"
3. **Cleaning → Enrichment:** "Your data is clean - now let's fill in the gaps"
4. **Enrichment → Analysis:** "Let's analyze this data to find your ICP"

## Discounts

| Scenario | Discount |
|----------|----------|
| Annual retainer | 10-15% |
| Large volume (100K+) | Negotiate per-record |
| Non-profit | 20% |
| Referral | 10% for both parties |

## Quoting Process

1. Client describes data challenge
2. Ask for sample data or record count
3. Determine services needed
4. Calculate based on per-record pricing
5. Add margin buffer (10-20%)
6. Send fixed quote within 24 hours
7. No surprises - quote is the price
