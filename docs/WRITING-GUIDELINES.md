# Verum Writing Guidelines

## Anti-AI Detection Writing Style

These guidelines ensure authentic, human-sounding copy that won't be flagged as AI-generated.

### What to DO

1. **Use contractions** - "we're" not "we are", "doesn't" not "does not"

2. **Vary sentence length dramatically** - Mix punchy 4-word sentences with longer, flowing ones. A paragraph might have a 6-word sentence followed by a 25-word one.

3. **Add natural pauses** - Organic breaks that let thoughts breathe. Use periods to end thoughts cleanly. Use commas for rhythm, not just grammar. Let strong statements stand alone. Natural pauses create flow when read aloud, like where you'd take a breath.

4. **Include occasional tangents** - Brief detours that show personality, then return to the point

5. **Use relatable metaphors** - Compare data problems to everyday frustrations readers know

6. **Add small asides, second thoughts, or casual observations** - Show the reader you understand their world. These should feel organic, not performed.

7. **Show you understand the reader** - Acknowledge their reality, frustrations, and constraints

### What to AVOID (AI Detection Flags)

- **Em-dashes** - Use very rarely. They're heavily flagged as AI-generated now.

- **Performative interjections** - Things like "That's not a typo." or "Good question." or "And honestly?" These scream AI trying to sound human.

- **Commentary after stats** - Don't follow a number with "Let that sink in" or "You read that right."

- **Forced casual phrases** - "Here's the thing:" or "Spoiler alert:" or "Plot twist:"

- **Rhetorical questions followed by answers** - "What does this mean? It means..."

- **Overly parallel structure** - Three bullets that all start the same way

### What WORKS (Human Patterns)

- Short sentences that just end. No commentary needed.
- Thoughts that trail into the next paragraph naturally
- Varied paragraph lengths. Some long. Some just one sentence.
- Specific details only someone in the industry would know
- Admitting uncertainty or limitations occasionally
- Second-person "you" that speaks directly to the reader's situation

### Voice Check

Read it out loud. If it sounds like a person talking to a colleague, you're on track. If you hear yourself performing casualness, rewrite it.

## General Content Voice

- **Professional but approachable**: B2B enterprise, not stuffy
- **Confident without arrogance**: We understand data challenges
- **Specific over generic**: "Client records in 5 systems causing $50K/year in duplicate work" not "data silos"
- **Active voice**: "Verum normalizes" not "records are normalized"

## SEO Content Requirements

### Meta Tags
- **Title tag**: Under 60 characters, include primary keyword
- **Meta description**: Under 155 characters, include benefit and implied CTA

### Structure
- One H1 per page
- H2s/H3s in sequential order (don't skip levels)
- Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max)
- Bullet points for scanability

### Internal Linking
- 3-5 internal links per page minimum
- Link to related services, solutions, and resources
- Use descriptive anchor text

---

## CTA Placement

Include clear calls-to-action:
- **Hero section**: Both primary ("Clean My Data") and secondary ("Get Free Assessment") CTAs visible
- **After pain section**: Link to assessment
- **After solution section**: Link to contact
- **Final section**: Both CTAs with clear paths

---

## Industry-Specific Content

When writing for specific industries:
- Use industry terminology throughout
- Reference specific tech stack (e.g., Salesforce, Kantata, Clio for professional services)
- Include industry-specific pain points and metrics
- Cite relevant statistics with sources
- Make sure every paragraph could ONLY apply to that industry
