# Landing Page Best Practices

*Source: Harry Dry / Marketing Examples*

## Overview

A landing page has two parts:
1. **Above the fold** - What's immediately visible
2. **Below the fold** - What the user scrolls to

> "A caveman should be able to glance at it and immediately grunt back what you offer." — Donald Miller

## Above the Fold (Earn Attention)

In five seconds customers try to establish whether or not you can help them. Make their life easy. **Clarity over creativity.**

### 1. Title — Explain the value you provide

Three ways to write a great title:

**Option A: Explain what you do**
- When your product is unique, explain what you do as simply as possible
- Example: "Send better email" (Mailchimp)

**Option B: Use a hook**
- Most products aren't unique, so a hook adds oomph
- Address your customer's biggest objection
- Example: "Finally, email that people actually read"

**Option C: Own your niche**
- Write with conviction. You're THE solution.
- Example: "The #1 platform for [X]"

**Verum's title:** "Bad data costs you money" (Hook - addresses the pain)

### 2. Subtitle — Explain how you'll create the value

Subtitles are where you get specific:
- Introduce the product
- Explain how it creates the value in your title

**Verum's subtitle:** "Duplicates, missing fields, outdated records. Every data problem slows your team down and eats into revenue. We fix that."

### 3. Visual — Let the user visualise it

Show off your product in all its glory. Get as close to reality as possible.

**DO:**
- Show your product
- Show your product in action
- Show results/outcomes

**DON'T:**
- Fancy illustrations
- Stock photos
- Abstract graphics

### 4. Social Proof — Make it believable

Social proof above the fold adds instant credibility to the value you're promising.

Examples:
- "18,000+ reviews"
- "Trusted by [logos]"
- "4.9/5 stars"

**Verum's approach:** Metrics (93% deliverability, <24hr turnaround, 50+ sources)

### 5. CTA — Make taking the next step easy

Three compelling CTA types:

**Option A: Call to value**
- Emphasize "value" over "action"
- Fulfill the value your title promises
- Example: "Clean My Data" instead of "Get Started"

**Option B: Objection handle**
- Add words to handle the user's biggest objection
- Example: "Start free trial — no credit card required"

**Option C: Email capture + CTA**
- Pair email capture with CTA to make signing up easy
- Collect additional info during onboarding

**Verum's CTA:** "Clean My Data" (Call to value)

## Below the Fold (Earn the Sale)

Above the fold you earn the customer's attention. Below the fold you earn the sale.

### 6. Features & Objections — Make the value concrete

**Features:**
- Make concrete the value you promise above the fold
- Example: If you promise "podcasts that look amazing," show the specific features that make it happen

**Objections:**
- Talk to customers
- Group recurring objections
- Use their own words to handle them

### 7. More Social Proof — Inspire action

Above the fold social proof = credibility
Below the fold social proof = inspiring action

Use existing customers to bring to life the value you promise:
- "Get a smile you love" → Customers smiling
- "Email reinvented" → Customers describing the difference
- "How small brands sell more" → Sales numbers

**Verum's approach:** Personas (RevOps, Sales Ops, Marketing Ops) with quotes

### 8. FAQ — Tie up loose ends

Features and objections that don't fit neatly above go here:
- Write them down
- Reframe into questions and answers

### 9. 2nd CTA — Repeat your call to action

We've done the hard selling. Time for the 2nd CTA.

You have the luxury of space now, so:
- Remind the customer why they're clicking
- Reinforce the value proposition
- Make it easy to take action

### 10. Founder's Note — Make yourself memorable

Leave the customer with a story that makes you easy to sum up:

1. Put yourself in their shoes
2. Explain their problem
3. Take ownership of it
4. Show the happy ending

You're walking them down a path they'll want to walk themselves. **People buy from people.**

**Verum's founder note:**
> "I built Verum after watching sales teams waste millions on bad data. Your reps deserve better leads. Your ops team deserves cleaner systems."
> — Rome, Founder

## The Ultimate Test

Your landing page is your sales pitch. Examine each element and ask:

> **Would this help me sell if I met the customer in person?**

- If not, remove it
- If you don't know, go out and sell to customers in person

You'll learn that fancy words and random images of people shaking hands don't get you far. More importantly, you'll learn the attitude of your customer and the words you need to convince them.
