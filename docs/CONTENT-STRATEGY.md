# Verum Content Strategy

## Navigation Structure

### Current Header Nav
```
Services | Solutions | Assessment | Pricing | Contact
```

### Future Nav (When Content is Ready)
```
Services | Solutions | Resources ▼ | Pricing | Contact
                      └── Case Studies
                      └── Blog
```

**Important:** Assessment should NEVER go under Resources. It's a lead magnet and needs to stay prominent alongside the contact CTA.

### When to Add Content to Nav

| Content Type | Threshold | Location |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Case Studies | 3+ studies | Footer first, then header under "Resources" |
| Blog | 5-8 posts | Footer first, then header under "Resources" |
| Assessment | Always visible | Header nav (lead magnet) |

## AI Messaging Strategy (January 2026)

### Decision
Verum is AI-powered. We added AI messaging for both SEO (capture "AI data cleaning" searches) and positioning (modern, competitive).

### Implementation

**Hero Section:**
- Title: "Bad data costs you money" (unchanged — proven hook)
- Subtitle: "AI cleans and enriches your data in 24 hours. Human-verified, revenue-ready."

**Why this subtitle works (Harry Dry principles):**
- Short and punchy (not wordy)
- Introduces what happens (AI cleans and enriches)
- Specific proof points (24 hours, human-verified)
- Ties back to title's value promise (revenue-ready)
- Sounds human, not AI-generated

**Service Cards:**
- "AI-Powered Data Cleaning"
- "AI-Powered Data Enrichment"
- "AI-Powered Data Analysis"

**Stats Bar:**
- Added 4th stat: "AI Powered accuracy"

**How It Works Step 2:**
- "Our AI cleans and enriches" + "Human QA on every file"

**SEO Metadata:**
- Title: "AI-Powered B2B Data Cleaning & Enrichment | Verum"
- Description includes "AI" keywords

**New FAQ:**
- "How does your AI work?" — explains ML models + human QA

### What NOT to Do
- Don't add "AI" to every sentence
- Don't use hollow phrases like "cutting-edge AI" or "revolutionary AI"
- Don't remove the problem-focused messaging
- Keep the founder's note as-is (authenticity)

## Case Study Best Practices

### Structure (based on ICP Analysis case study)

1. **Hero:** Curiosity-sparking subtitle (don't reveal the key finding)
2. **Meta bar:** Industry, Stage, Analysis Type, Records Analyzed
3. **Results upfront:** Show the payoff immediately (builds credibility)
4. **The Challenge:** What problem they faced
5. **The Analysis:** What we did
6. **The Key Finding:** The insight (this is what they scrolled for)
7. **Supporting data:** Tables, additional findings
8. **Strategic Recommendations:** What we delivered
9. **CTA:** Get your own analysis

### Example Subtitle Pattern
❌ "A multi-dimensional ICP analysis revealed that RevOps team size predicted 4x differences in LTV"
✅ "A multi-dimensional ICP analysis revealed that a single variable predicted a 4x increase in customer lifetime value"

The second version creates curiosity — reader scrolls to find out WHAT the variable is.

## Blog Post SEO Targets

| RevOps Team Size | "RevOps customer success", "customer LTV analysis", "RevOps team size" |
| Data-Driven ICP | "how to build ICP", "data-driven ICP", "ideal customer profile analysis" |
