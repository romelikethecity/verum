<h2>Business Prospecting</h2>
<p>Business prospecting is only as good as the data behind it. If your prospect list has wrong emails, outdated titles, and missing phone numbers, your outreach is wasted effort. We build and clean prospect lists so every record is accurate, complete, and ready for outreach.</p>

<p>Your sales team spends 30-40% of their time researching prospects instead of selling. They're Googling company info, hunting for direct dials on LinkedIn, and guessing at email formats. That research time should be selling time.</p>

<h2>How We Build Better Prospect Lists</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Target criteria definition.</strong> Tell us your ICP: industry, company size, geography, titles. We build a custom list matching your exact specifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-source discovery.</strong> We pull from 50+ data sources to find prospects, cross-referencing to verify accuracy. Not just one database with one set of stale data.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact verification.</strong> Every email gets deliverability-tested. Every phone number gets validated. Titles get confirmed against current sources. Bad data never reaches your CRM.</li>
    <li><strong>Enrichment.</strong> Each prospect record includes firmographic context — company size, revenue, industry, tech stack — so your reps can personalize outreach without additional research.</li>
    <li><strong>CRM-ready delivery.</strong> Records are formatted for your CRM's import requirements. No cleanup needed on your end.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prospecting Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>SDRs who spend time on calls and emails instead of research because every prospect is already complete</li>
    <li>Email deliverability above 95% because every address has been verified before outreach</li>
    <li>Higher connect rates on cold calls because phone numbers are validated direct dials, not main lines</li>
    <li>Faster ramp time for new reps because they start with ready-to-work prospect data from day one</li>
    <li>Better pipeline quality because prospects are verified fits before anyone picks up the phone</li>
</ul>
