        <h2>The Business Prospecting Problem</h2>

        <p>Your marketing team generates leads. Your sales team gets a list of company names. And then the real work begins.</p>

        <p>Who are these businesses? Are they big enough to afford your product? Are they in an industry you serve? Do they use technology that integrates with yours? Who's the right person to contact? What's their email? Their phone number?</p>

        <p>The answers to these questions exist, scattered across LinkedIn, company websites, press releases, SEC filings, and a dozen other places. Your sales reps spend hours hunting for this information. Or they skip the research entirely and blast generic outreach to everyone, hoping something sticks.</p>

        <p>Neither approach works well. Research eats into selling time. Generic outreach gets ignored. And even when reps do their homework, they're often working with outdated information. That "VP of Marketing" left six months ago. That "500-employee company" was actually 50 people, and now your enterprise rep wasted a call on an SMB.</p>

        <h3>The hidden cost of incomplete prospect data</h3>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce research</a>, sales reps spend only 27% of their time actually selling. The rest goes to administrative tasks, internal meetings, and research. A significant chunk of that research time is hunting for basic information that should already be in your CRM.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-improve-your-data-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner estimates</a> that poor data quality costs organizations an average of $12.9 million per year. That number includes the obvious costs (bounced emails, disconnected phone numbers) and the hidden ones (reps calling the wrong person, pursuing accounts that were never going to close, missing opportunities because they didn't know a company was a fit).</p>

        <p>And the problem compounds over time. <a href="https://www.dun-bradstreet.com/perspectives/blogs/b2b-data-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dun & Bradstreet research</a> shows that B2B data decays at roughly 30-40% per year. People change jobs. Companies get acquired. Phone numbers change. The prospect list you built six months ago is already significantly stale.</p>

        <h3>The real-world impact</h3>

        <p>A B2B software company came to us with a list of 15,000 target accounts. Marketing had identified these companies as potential fits based on industry and company size. Sales was supposed to work through the list.</p>

        <p>When we analyzed their data, we found problems everywhere. Industry classification was missing for 35% of accounts. Company size was self-reported and often wildly inaccurate. Contact information existed for maybe 20% of accounts, and much of it was generic info@ addresses.</p>

        <p>Their SDRs were spending two hours a day researching prospects before making calls. When they did reach someone, they often didn't have enough context to have a meaningful conversation. "We sell software" only gets you so far when you don't know what challenges the company faces or what tools they currently use.</p>

        <p>After enrichment, their data looked completely different. Complete firmographics on 95% of accounts. Tech stack data showing which companies used complementary or competitive products. Verified email addresses and direct dial numbers for key contacts. SDRs could actually prioritize accounts based on fit, not just work alphabetically through a list.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide for Business Prospecting</h2>

        <p>Business prospecting requires two things: knowing which companies to target and being able to actually reach them. We provide data for both.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Data</h3>

        <p>The foundation of effective prospecting is knowing which businesses fit your ideal customer profile.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Standardized SIC and NAICS codes, not whatever someone typed in a form. Know exactly what business each company is in so you can prioritize industries that convert.</li>

          <li><strong>Company size.</strong> Employee count and revenue ranges from verified sources. Not self-reported data that's years old. Know whether you're talking to an SMB or an enterprise before you pick up the phone.</li>

          <li><strong>Location data.</strong> Headquarters, office locations, geographic footprint. Critical if you sell regionally or need to understand where a company operates.</li>

          <li><strong>Company structure.</strong> Parent companies, subsidiaries, ownership. Know if that "small company" is actually a division of a Fortune 500.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technographic Data</h3>

        <p>What tools a company uses tells you a lot about their sophistication, budget, and potential fit.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Tech stack detection.</strong> CRM, marketing automation, analytics, cloud infrastructure. If you integrate with Salesforce, knowing which prospects use Salesforce is pretty important.</li>

          <li><strong>Competitive intelligence.</strong> Which prospects use your competitors? Those are warm leads. Which use nothing in your category? They might not be ready to buy.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology signals.</strong> Recent technology adoptions, job postings for specific technical roles, infrastructure changes. Signs of where a company is investing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Contact Data</h3>

        <p>Firmographics tell you which companies to target. Contact data tells you who to call.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified email addresses.</strong> Not just syntactically valid. Deliverable. We check against bounce lists and verify mailbox existence. Bad emails hurt your sender reputation.</li>

          <li><strong>Direct dial phone numbers.</strong> Main switchboard numbers are useless for reaching decision-makers. We find direct lines that actually get answered.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn profiles.</strong> Verified and current. We catch when someone has left a company so you don't waste time reaching out to ghosts.</li>

          <li><strong>Job title and seniority.</strong> Know who you're contacting. Are they the decision-maker or an influencer? Filter and prioritize accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Intent and Growth Signals</h3>

        <p>Static firmographics tell you about fit. Signals tell you about timing.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Funding and investment.</strong> Recently funded companies often expand vendor relationships. Know who just raised a round.</li>

          <li><strong>Hiring patterns.</strong> Companies posting jobs in relevant departments might be growing into your solution. A company hiring five salespeople is in a different mode than one posting for a restructuring consultant.</li>

          <li><strong>Executive changes.</strong> New leadership often means new vendor evaluations. A new CTO might want to replace the tech stack their predecessor chose.</li>

          <li><strong>Expansion signals.</strong> New office openings, geographic expansion, M&A activity. Signs of growth that might create opportunities.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your prospect list.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, or any CRM. Send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have. Company names and domains are enough to start.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze your data gaps.</strong> Before enriching anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Which firmographic fields are blank. Which contacts lack verified information. Estimated match rates for what we can fill in.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, LinkedIn, SEC filings, job postings, proprietary databases, and more. Multiple sources per field ensure accuracy. We don't just scrape one database and call it done.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA on every record.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans handle judgment calls. Industry classifications that aren't obvious. Company sizes that don't match public data. Contacts with common names that could match multiple people. We verify before we deliver.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Clean data returned.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to import. Or we can push directly to your CRM. Your prospect database finally has the information sales needs to prioritize and personalize.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Business prospecting enrichment runs $0.10-0.50 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full firmographic plus contact enrichment is at the higher end. Single-field projects (just industry classification, for example) are lower.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data and understanding what you need.</p>

        <p>For ongoing prospecting support, we offer monthly retainers starting at $2,000. Your prospect data stays fresh, new accounts get enriched automatically, and you never fall behind on data maintenance.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What data do you provide for business prospecting?</h3>
          <p>We provide firmographic data (industry, company size, revenue, location), technographic data (tech stack, tools in use), contact data (verified emails, direct dials, LinkedIn profiles), and intent signals (funding, hiring, expansion). Everything you need to identify and prioritize the right businesses.</p>

          <h3>How accurate is your business prospecting data?</h3>
          <p>We typically see 85-95% match rates on firmographic fields and 70-85% on contact data. Every record goes through human QA after automated enrichment. We cross-reference 50+ data sources and flag anything we can't verify.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from buying a ZoomInfo or Apollo license?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences. First, different problem: ZoomInfo and Apollo help you find net-new contacts. We enrich your existing prospect lists with verified, current data. Second, different pricing: They charge $15K-$50K+ annually. We work on a per-project basis. Third, different ownership: Their data disappears when you cancel. Your enriched data is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>How long does business prospecting enrichment take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets (50,000+ records) or custom research requests may take longer. We'll give you a timeline estimate after reviewing your data.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Prospect Smarter?</h2>

        <p>Two paths forward:</p>
