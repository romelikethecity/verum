        <h2>The Territory Planning Problem</h2>

        <p>Every year, the same ritual. You pull accounts from the CRM, sort by geography, try to balance workload across your sales team. And every year, the same problems.</p>

        <p>Half your accounts have incomplete location data. Some show a billing address in Delaware when the real headquarters is in Texas. Others list a branch office instead of the decision-making center. Parent companies and subsidiaries scattered across territories like they're unrelated.</p>

        <p>You build territories based on what you can see. Then reality hits. One rep has twice the viable accounts as another. Enterprise deals hiding in SMB territories. Strategic accounts assigned to reps who don't have the experience to work them.</p>

        <p>A $950M medical device company faced exactly this issue. They had 120,000+ contact records spread across six states. Location data was inconsistent. Some records showed abbreviated state names, others spelled out. Some had zip codes that didn't match the city listed.</p>

        <p>Their territory assignments were essentially guesswork.</p>

        <h3>What we discovered</h3>

        <p>When we cleaned and enriched their data, we found geographic clustering they couldn't see before. Accounts that appeared evenly distributed were actually concentrated in specific metro areas. Some territories had 3x the account potential of others.</p>

        <p>We also mapped 305 subsidiaries to 122 parent companies. Sales reps were calling on different divisions of the same organization without realizing it. Territory assignments that looked balanced on paper were creating internal competition and confused buyers.</p>

        <h3>The results</h3>

        <p>What would have taken a contractor 60 weeks of manual work, we completed in days. Their territories finally reflected reality. Parent companies stayed with a single rep. Geographic assignments matched actual business locations, not arbitrary mailing addresses.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl mb-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See What's Hiding in Your Territory Data</a>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide for Territory Planning</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified headquarters locations.</strong> The actual decision-making location, not a random branch office or registered agent address. State, city, zip code standardized and validated.</li>

          <li><strong>Employee count.</strong> Current headcount for sizing territory potential. Not the number from when they were founded or last updated their LinkedIn page.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue range.</strong> Annual revenue bands for balancing territories by dollar potential, not just account count. We use multiple signals when public data isn't available.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Standardized codes so you can assign industry specialists to the right accounts. NAICS, SIC, or custom taxonomies that match your segmentation.</li>

          <li><strong>Parent/subsidiary mapping.</strong> Know which accounts roll up to the same organization. Keep related entities with the same rep. Stop creating internal competition.</li>

          <li><strong>Address standardization.</strong> Consistent formatting. State abbreviations normalized. Zip codes validated against cities. Data that actually sorts and filters correctly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your account data.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, or send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and identify gaps.</strong> Before we enrich anything, you'll see exactly what's missing or inconsistent. Location coverage rates. Company data gaps. Potential duplicates.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, SEC filings, business registrations, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Companies that share names with unrelated businesses. Subsidiaries that aren't obvious from the company name.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: You get enriched data back.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to import. Your territory planning finally has accurate data to work with.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Territory planning data enrichment runs $0.10-0.30 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full firmographic and location enrichment is at the higher end. Location-only projects are lower.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
