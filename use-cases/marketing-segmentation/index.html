        <h2>The Marketing Segmentation Problem</h2>

        <p>You've built segments in your marketing automation platform. Enterprise versus mid-market versus SMB. Maybe industry verticals. Perhaps a few behavioral segments based on engagement.</p>

        <p>The problem is your underlying data. Industry is blank for a third of your contacts. Company size comes from when someone filled out a form three years ago. Your "enterprise" segment includes companies with 50 employees because someone checked the wrong box.</p>

        <p>So your "personalized" campaigns go to the wrong people. Enterprise messaging lands in mid-market inboxes. Industry-specific content reaches accounts in completely different verticals. Your engagement rates suffer because the targeting is off.</p>

        <p>A B2B platform we worked with had exactly this challenge. They had 315 closed deals to analyze, customers across multiple segments, and a vague sense that some customer types were better than others. They couldn't tell which ones.</p>

        <h3>What we discovered</h3>

        <p>We analyzed their data across five dimensions: company growth velocity, SDR team size, CRM platform, geographic distribution, and RevOps team maturity. Standard stuff. What wasn't standard was what we found.</p>

        <p>RevOps team size was the strongest predictor of customer success. Not company size. Not industry. Not funding stage. Companies with exactly two RevOps people had an $8,750 lifetime value and 62% win rates. Companies with one RevOps person had $2,100 LTV but 68% win rates. Companies with three or more? 55% churn.</p>

        <p>This wasn't a segment anyone had considered. "Number of RevOps people" isn't a standard firmographic field. But it was the most predictive attribute in their entire database.</p>

        <p>We also found CRM platform mattered enormously. Dynamics CRM users had a 99% win rate. Pipedrive users had 7%. That's not a small difference. That's the difference between a viable market and a money pit.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide for Marketing Segmentation</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Standardized codes that match your segmentation model. Know which accounts belong in which vertical. No more blank industry fields.</li>

          <li><strong>Company size tiers.</strong> Employee count and revenue ranges validated against multiple sources. Your size-based segments actually include the right companies.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use. Segment by CRM platform, marketing automation, or any technology that matters to your product.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth signals.</strong> Funding data, headcount changes, expansion news. Segment by growth trajectory, not just current size.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic data.</strong> Headquarters location for regional segmentation. Territory alignment. Compliance-based targeting.</li>

          <li><strong>Custom attributes.</strong> If it exists in public data, we can likely find it. Job title patterns, hiring activity, technology adoption signals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your marketing database.</strong> Export from your CRM, MAP, or send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and identify gaps.</strong> Before we enrich anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Which fields have low coverage. What we can fill.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, LinkedIn, SEC filings, job postings, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Industry classifications that need judgment. Companies that could fit multiple categories.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: You get enriched data back.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to power better segments. Complete data for every account.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Segmentation data enrichment runs $0.10-0.50 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full firmographic plus technographic enrichment is at the higher end. Single-field projects are lower.</p>

        <p>For segment analysis and ICP development, projects start at $1,500. We'll give you a fixed quote after understanding your goals.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What data do you provide for segmentation?</h3>
          <p>We provide firmographic data (industry, size, revenue), technographic data (tech stack, tools), and can integrate with your behavioral data to build comprehensive segments.</p>

          <h3>Can you help identify which segments perform best?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Our data analysis services can identify which segments have the highest LTV, lowest churn, best win rates, and fastest sales cycles.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from the segments in our CRM?</h3>
          <p>CRM segments are only as good as the data they're built on. If industry is blank for half your accounts, your industry segments are incomplete. We fill the gaps.</p>

          <h3>What if we don't know how to segment our market?</h3>
          <p>We can help. Our ICP analysis service examines your customer data to identify which attributes actually predict success.</p>
