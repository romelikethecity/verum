<h2>Lead Routing</h2>
<p>Lead routing sends new leads to the right sales rep based on criteria like geography, company size, industry, or account ownership. When those fields are missing, inconsistent, or wrong, leads get misrouted. The fix isn't better routing rules — it's better data.</p>

<p>Your routing is set up perfectly: enterprise leads go to enterprise reps, SMB leads go to SMB reps, West Coast goes to the West Coast team. But 30% of leads are missing the company size field, industry has 50 different unstandardized values, and addresses are incomplete. Your routing logic is fine. Your data is broken.</p>

<h2>How Clean Data Fixes Routing</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Field completion.</strong> We fill in the fields your routing depends on: company size, industry, location, seniority level. No more leads going to the default queue because a key field is blank.</li>
    <li><strong>Value standardization.</strong> We normalize field values so 'Financial Services' and 'Finance' and 'Banking' map to the same routing rule instead of creating three different routing paths.</li>
    <li><strong>Account matching.</strong> We match incoming leads to existing accounts so leads at current customers route to the account owner instead of an SDR who doesn't know the relationship exists.</li>
    <li><strong>Territory mapping.</strong> We standardize geographic data — state, region, country — so territory-based routing works consistently across all lead sources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routing Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fewer misrouted leads because the fields your routing rules depend on are actually filled in and correct</li>
    <li>Faster speed-to-lead because leads go directly to the right rep without manual reassignment</li>
    <li>Better sales experience for prospects because they're connected with a rep who understands their segment</li>
    <li>Less time wasted on routing corrections by ops teams who manually fix misassigned leads</li>
</ul>
