        <h2>The Lead Routing Problem</h2>

        <p>You've built sophisticated routing rules. Enterprise leads go to your senior AEs. Mid-market goes to the growth team. SMB gets the inside sales treatment. Specific industries route to specialists who speak that language.</p>

        <p>There's just one problem. Half your leads come in with nothing but a name and email address.</p>

        <p>No company size. No industry. No location. Your routing logic fires on empty fields and sends enterprise prospects to SDRs who aren't equipped to handle them. Or worse, routes them to the wrong territory entirely.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had exactly this issue. They had 50,000 accounts in their CRM. Industry classifications were missing for thousands of records. Employee counts were blank for nearly 10% of the database. Their routing rules were making decisions based on incomplete information.</p>

        <p>The real cost wasn't just misrouted leads. It was the hidden segments they couldn't see at all.</p>

        <h3>What we discovered</h3>

        <p>When we enriched their data, we found 703 MSP accounts buried in generic "Partner" categories. For a data protection company, managed service providers aren't just customers. They're force multipliers. One MSP can deploy your solution across dozens of end clients.</p>

        <p>These accounts had been sitting in the database for years. Nobody knew they existed because the industry classification was wrong or missing entirely. Their routing rules couldn't send MSP leads to the MSP team if the system didn't know they were MSPs.</p>

        <p>We also mapped 305 subsidiaries to 122 parent companies. Sales reps had been accidentally pitching different divisions of the same organization, unaware they were already customers under a different name.</p>

        <h3>The results</h3>

        <p>98.6% industry classification coverage after enrichment. 91.8% employee count coverage. Their routing rules finally had the data they needed to work correctly.</p>

        <p>Those 703 MSPs? If the average MSP deal is $25K annually and they convert just 5%, that's 35 new deals. $875,000 in new annual recurring revenue from accounts that were already in their CRM, just misclassified.</p>

        <h2>What We Enrich for Lead Routing</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Employee count.</strong> Current headcount validated against multiple sources. Not the number from when they were founded. Accurate enough to route by company size.</li>

          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Standardized codes that match your routing rules. Not free-text descriptions that vary by who entered the record. NAICS, SIC, or custom taxonomies.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue range.</strong> Annual revenue bands for prioritization. We use multiple signals when public data isn't available.</li>

          <li><strong>Headquarters location.</strong> Country, state, city. Territory assignment that actually reflects where companies are based, not where a random office happens to be.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use. Route leads to reps who specialize in replacing specific competitors or integrating with specific platforms.</li>

          <li><strong>Parent/subsidiary relationships.</strong> Know when you're routing a division versus the corporate entity. Stop treating the same company as multiple unrelated accounts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your leads.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, Marketo, or send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and identify gaps.</strong> Before we enrich anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Match rate estimates by field. Expected coverage for your specific dataset.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, LinkedIn, SEC filings, job postings, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Parent companies that share names with unrelated businesses. Industry classifications that need judgment calls.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: You get enriched data back.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to import. Your routing rules finally have data to work with.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Lead enrichment for routing runs $0.10-0.30 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full firmographic enrichment is at the higher end. Single-field enrichment (just employee count, just industry) is lower.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
