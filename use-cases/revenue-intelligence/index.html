        <h2>The Revenue Intelligence Problem</h2>

        <p>You've invested in revenue intelligence. Dashboards showing ARR by segment. Churn analysis by cohort. Win rate trends by industry. The reports look impressive.</p>

        <p>But the underlying data is a mess. Industry classification is blank for 30% of customers. Company size is whatever someone entered when the deal closed, not what it is today. Half your "enterprise" customers are actually mid-market because the original rep wanted a bigger deal classification.</p>

        <p>So your revenue intelligence is telling you stories that aren't true. You think healthcare is your fastest-growing segment, but it might just be the segment with the most complete industry data. You think enterprise customers have higher LTV, but your enterprise segment includes companies that aren't actually enterprise.</p>

        <p>A B2B platform we analyzed had exactly this problem. They had revenue reports by segment, but when we examined their 315 closed deals, we found the segments they were tracking weren't the segments that actually mattered.</p>

        <h3>What the data revealed</h3>

        <p>Company size and industry, their two primary segmentation dimensions, were weak predictors of revenue. The real patterns were hiding in attributes they'd never tracked.</p>

        <p>RevOps team structure predicted lifetime value better than anything else. Companies with exactly two RevOps people had $8,750 LTV. Companies with one RevOps person had $2,100 LTV. Same company size. Same industry. Four times the revenue difference.</p>

        <p>CRM platform predicted win rates dramatically. Dynamics CRM users closed at 99%. Pipedrive users closed at 7%. Their revenue reports by industry were showing noise. Revenue reports by CRM platform would have shown signal.</p>

        <p>We also identified $2 million per year in preventable churn. Customers with three or more RevOps people churned at 55%. Customers using multiple CRMs churned at 58%. These weren't random losses. These were predictable losses they could have prevented if they'd known to watch for these patterns.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide for Revenue Intelligence</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry standardization.</strong> Consistent classification across all customers so your revenue-by-industry analysis is actually accurate. Not self-reported categories. Real classifications.</li>

          <li><strong>Company size validation.</strong> Current employee count and revenue ranges, not what was entered at deal close. Know if your "enterprise" customers are still enterprise.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack data.</strong> What tools your customers use. Analyze revenue by tech stack. Identify which platforms correlate with high LTV versus high churn.</li>

          <li><strong>Organizational data.</strong> Team structure, department sizes, growth trajectory. If team composition predicts revenue outcomes, you need that data point.</li>

          <li><strong>Parent/subsidiary mapping.</strong> Know which customers are actually divisions of the same organization. Roll up revenue correctly. Stop double-counting related entities.</li>

          <li><strong>Churn signal enrichment.</strong> Growth indicators, funding data, headcount changes. Spot the warning signs in your customer base before they become cancellations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your customer data.</strong> Export from your CRM, billing system, or data warehouse. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze coverage gaps.</strong> Before enriching anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Which segmentation fields are blank. Where your revenue analysis is flying blind.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, LinkedIn, SEC filings, job postings, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Industry classifications that need judgment. Company sizes that don't match public data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Revenue-ready data returned.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to import. Your revenue intelligence finally has complete data to analyze.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Customer data enrichment for revenue intelligence runs $0.10-0.50 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full firmographic plus technographic enrichment is at the higher end. Single-field projects are lower.</p>

        <p>For ICP analysis to identify which segments actually drive revenue, projects start at $1,500. We'll tell you what to analyze, not just fill in the blanks.</p>
