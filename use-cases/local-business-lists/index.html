<h2>Local Business Lists</h2>
<p>Local business list building creates targeted prospect lists of businesses within specific geographies: a city, a metro area, a county, or a custom-defined territory. Each business on the list includes verified contact information for the owner or key decision-maker.</p>

<p>Google Maps shows you businesses in an area, but it doesn't give you the owner's name, direct phone number, or email. Business directories are outdated. Yellow Pages is from 2015. Building a local business list manually means hours of research per market with inconsistent results.</p>

<h2>How We Build Local Business Lists</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Market definition.</strong> Tell us the geography (city, ZIP code, county, metro area) and the business types you want. We handle the research from there.</li>
    <li><strong>Business discovery.</strong> We pull from business registrations, licensing databases, Google Business profiles, and industry-specific directories to build a complete list of businesses in your target market.</li>
    <li><strong>Owner identification.</strong> We identify the owner, managing partner, or key decision-maker at each business, not just the business name and address.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact enrichment.</strong> Each record gets verified email addresses and phone numbers for the decision-maker, not just the business main line.</li>
    <li><strong>Data delivery.</strong> The list arrives formatted for your CRM, ready to import, with all fields standardized and verified.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your List Includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Business name, address, and category for every matching business in your target geography</li>
    <li>Owner or decision-maker name with verified email and direct phone number</li>
    <li>Business firmographics: employee count, estimated revenue, years in business where available</li>
    <li>Geographic tagging for territory assignment and proximity-based outreach</li>
</ul>
