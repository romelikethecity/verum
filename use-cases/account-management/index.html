        <h2>Account Management Without Data Is Just Guessing</h2>

        <p>Renewal is coming up. You need to know: Is the champion still there? Has the company grown? Are they using competitive products? Who else should you be talking to? One hour of prep, digging through LinkedIn and Google, and you still don't have the full picture.</p>

        <p><strong>Champions leave without warning.</strong> About 30% of B2B contacts change jobs every year. Your CRM still shows them. The renewal email bounces. You find out too late that your advocate left six months ago and nobody's been nurturing the replacement.</p>

        <p><strong>Accounts are deeper than you think.</strong> You sold to marketing. IT is frustrated they weren't consulted. Finance has budget questions nobody anticipated. The org chart in your CRM has five people. The actual buying committee has fifteen.</p>

        <p><strong>Growth signals hide in plain sight.</strong> Your customer just raised a Series C. They're hiring across every department. Opening three new offices. Perfect expansion opportunity, except nobody told account management. They found out when the customer called to ask about enterprise pricing.</p>

        <p><strong>Multi-location complexity compounds.</strong> You sold to HQ. The UK office went with a competitor. The APAC team is evaluating options. Same company, fragmented relationship, no visibility into the full footprint.</p>

        <p>Account managers need complete intelligence. Not just what's in the CRM, but what's actually happening at the account.</p>

        <h2>Complete Account Intelligence</h2>

        <p>We enrich your account data with everything an account manager needs to protect and grow the relationship.</p>

        <p><strong>Organizational mapping.</strong> Key contacts across departments. Not just the people you've met, but the people who influence renewal, expansion, and competitive displacement. IT, finance, procurement, line-of-business leaders.</p>

        <p><strong>Contact monitoring.</strong> Track job changes at your key accounts. Get alerts when champions leave, new executives join, or organizational restructuring happens. Never be surprised by turnover again.</p>

        <p><strong>Firmographic depth.</strong> Revenue, employee count, funding status, growth trajectory. Is this account expanding or contracting? Investing or cutting?</p>

        <p><strong>Technographic intelligence.</strong> What's in their tech stack? What vendors are they using? Are they adding tools that complement yours, or evaluating competitors?</p>

        <p><strong>Corporate hierarchy.</strong> Parent company, subsidiaries, divisions, regional offices. Understand the full enterprise footprint for each account.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Enriched account profiles.</strong> Every key account with complete firmographic, technographic, and organizational data. The full picture in one place.</li>

          <li><strong>Expanded contact maps.</strong> Key contacts by department and function. Not just who you know, but who you should know.</li>

          <li><strong>Verified contact data.</strong> Current employment status, up-to-date contact information, LinkedIn profiles. Reach people without bounced emails.</li>

          <li><strong>Corporate hierarchies.</strong> Parent-subsidiary mapping. See the full enterprise footprint for multi-location accounts.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Account list.</strong> Identify the accounts that matter most. Top customers, renewal risks, expansion targets, strategic accounts.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Scoping call.</strong> What intelligence do you need? Contact mapping, tech stack, hierarchy, signals? We tailor to your priorities.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment.</strong> We pull data from 50+ sources, compile profiles, verify contacts. Typically 3-5 days for initial enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Delivery.</strong> Enriched account files ready for CRM import. Or direct push to Salesforce/HubSpot if preferred.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing monitoring (optional).</strong> Quarterly refreshes or continuous monitoring of your most important accounts. Alerts when something changes.</p>
