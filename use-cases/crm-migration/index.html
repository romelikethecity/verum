        <h2>Why CRM Migrations Fail</h2>

        <p>Everyone focuses on the technology. Which CRM to choose, how to configure it, what integrations to build. Then migration day comes and you realize the hard part was never the software. It was the data.</p>

        <p><strong>You're migrating garbage.</strong> That old CRM has years of accumulated mess. Duplicates, incomplete records, contacts who left three jobs ago. Moving it all to a shiny new system doesn't fix anything. You just have cleaner-looking garbage.</p>

        <p><strong>Different systems, different formats.</strong> Your old CRM stored phone numbers one way. The new one expects another format. Someone put full addresses in the city field. State abbreviations are inconsistent. These issues don't surface until you're knee-deep in migration troubleshooting.</p>

        <p><strong>Multiple sources make it worse.</strong> Consolidating two sales teams' CRMs? Merging an acquisition? You've got duplicate companies, conflicting data, and no clear answer for which record is right. The merge logic alone can take weeks.</p>

        <p><strong>Post-migration cleanup is painful.</strong> Cleaning data after migration means your team is trying to use a new system while simultaneously fixing the data in it. They lose trust in the CRM fast. Adoption suffers. Some people just go back to spreadsheets.</p>

        <p>The window for getting this right is before you migrate. Clean data goes in, clean data comes out.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Helps With CRM Migrations</h2>

        <p>We take your export files and return import-ready data. Cleaned, enriched, deduplicated, and formatted for your new system.</p>

        <p><strong>Deduplication across sources.</strong> Whether you're cleaning one CRM or consolidating three, we identify duplicates using fuzzy matching on company names, domains, and contact information. You decide the merge rules. We execute them.</p>

        <p><strong>Data validation and correction.</strong> We verify email addresses, standardize phone formats, normalize company names, and fix obvious errors. "Acme Corp", "Acme Corporation", and "ACME" become one clean record.</p>

        <p><strong>Enrichment to fill gaps.</strong> Missing industry classifications? Incomplete contact info? We append what's missing from 50+ data sources. Your new CRM starts with complete records, not partial ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Field mapping and transformation.</strong> We'll restructure your data to match your new CRM's schema. Different field names, different formats, different required fields. We handle the translation.</p>

        <p><strong>Human QA on everything.</strong> Automated tools catch most issues. Humans catch the rest. Every file gets reviewed before delivery.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Deduplicated master file.</strong> One clean record per company and contact. No duplicates to confuse your team on day one.</li>

          <li><strong>Validated contact data.</strong> Email addresses verified, phone numbers standardized, job titles normalized. Data that works from the first touch.</li>

          <li><strong>Enriched records.</strong> Gaps filled with firmographic data, contact details, and company information. Start with complete profiles.</li>

          <li><strong>Import-ready format.</strong> Fields mapped to your new CRM's structure. Headers renamed, data transformed, ready to upload.</li>

          <li><strong>Audit trail.</strong> Documentation of what changed, what merged, what enriched. Full transparency on the cleanup.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data export.</strong> Pull your records from your current CRM (or multiple sources). CSV, Excel, whatever format exports cleanly.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Scoping call.</strong> We review your data, understand your new CRM's requirements, and define the cleaning rules. What's a duplicate? Which source wins conflicts? What fields matter?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Processing.</strong> We clean, dedupe, validate, and enrich. Typically 24-48 hours for most datasets.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Review.</strong> You validate a sample. We adjust anything that doesn't look right.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery.</strong> Import-ready files matched to your new CRM's schema. Upload and go live with clean data.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 1-2 weeks from data handoff to delivery, depending on complexity.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>When should I clean data for migration?</h3>
          <p>Before you migrate. Cleaning in your old system or staging environment is easier than cleaning post-migration. Catch issues before they become problems in your new CRM.</p>

          <h3>How long does migration data prep take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 1-2 weeks. The actual processing is 24-48 hours. Planning and validation add some time.</p>

          <h3>What if we're consolidating multiple CRMs?</h3>
          <p>Common scenario. Different structures, duplicate records, conflicting data. We merge and dedupe across sources, creating one clean master record per entity.</p>

          <h3>Can you map fields between systems?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We handle field mapping, data transformation, and format standardization. You get import-ready files that match your new system's structure.</p>

          <h3>What about custom objects and relationships?</h3>
          <p>We can handle complex data structures. Parent-child relationships, custom objects, multi-entity hierarchies. Scoping call covers exactly what you need.</p>
