        <h2>The Sales Prospecting Problem</h2>

        <p>Your SDRs have a list of target accounts. Names, companies, maybe a generic company email. Now they need to actually reach these people.</p>

        <p>So they research. LinkedIn. Company websites. Google. Trying to find direct emails, phone numbers, anything that gets past the gatekeeper. Two hours later, they've found contact info for maybe a dozen prospects. Half of which will turn out to be wrong anyway.</p>

        <p>This is an expensive way to generate pipeline. A data protection company we worked with was facing exactly this issue. Their database had 50,000 accounts accumulated over 17 years. Contacts existed, but the information was stale. Emails bouncing. Phone numbers disconnected. People who'd changed jobs months or years ago.</p>

        <p>Their SDRs were spending more time researching than selling.</p>

        <h3>What we discovered</h3>

        <p>When we enriched their contact data, we found 525 LinkedIn profiles to verify current employment. Nearly 20% of their contact database was pointing at people who'd left their companies. Reps were leaving voicemails for people who would never call back because they no longer worked there.</p>

        <p>We caught 195 job changes. Each one a wasted call avoided and a new opportunity to reach the actual person in the role.</p>

        <p>Beyond contacts, we enriched 1,189 accounts with full firmographic data. Reps stopped walking into conversations blind. They knew company size, tech stack, recent funding. Conversations got better when reps actually understood who they were calling.</p>

          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"SDRs spent 2 hours a day researching prospects. Now they just call."</blockquote>

        <h2>What We Provide for Sales Prospecting</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified email addresses.</strong> Not just syntactically valid. Actually deliverable. We check against bounce lists and verify mailbox existence. Stop damaging your sender reputation with bad emails.</li>

          <li><strong>Direct dial phone numbers.</strong> Main office lines are useless for reaching decision-makers. We find direct numbers that actually get answered.</li>

          <li><strong>Mobile numbers.</strong> When the desk phone goes to voicemail, you have a backup. Mobile numbers have higher connect rates than office lines.</li>

          <li><strong>LinkedIn profiles.</strong> Verified and current. We catch when someone's profile shows "Former" for a company. No more researching people who left.</li>

          <li><strong>Job title and seniority.</strong> Know who you're calling. Is this the decision-maker or an influencer? Standardized titles so you can filter and prioritize correctly.</li>

          <li><strong>Job start date.</strong> New executives often mean new vendor evaluations. Know who just started and might be looking to make changes.</li>

          <li><strong>Company intel.</strong> Employee count, revenue range, tech stack, recent news. Walk into every call with context, not cold.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your prospect list.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, or send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and identify gaps.</strong> Before we enrich anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Contact coverage estimates. Expected match rates. What we can and can't find.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from LinkedIn, company websites, proprietary databases, and more. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Common names that could match multiple people. Companies with similar names. We verify before we ship.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: You get enriched data back.</strong> Same format you sent, ready for your SDRs to use. Direct to CRM or outreach tool if you prefer.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Sales prospecting enrichment runs $0.10-0.50 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full contact and firmographic enrichment is at the higher end. Email-only projects are lower.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
