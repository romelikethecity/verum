        <h2>The Database Merge Problem</h2>
        <p>You've just completed an acquisition. Or your sales and marketing teams finally agreed to consolidate their separate databases. Maybe you're migrating from three legacy systems into one modern CRM. Whatever the trigger, you're staring at the same problem: multiple databases that need to become one.</p>

        <p>On paper, it sounds simple. Export the data, import it into the new system, done. In reality, you're about to discover why data integration projects fail more often than they succeed.</p>

        <h3>Different Schemas, Different Worlds</h3>
        <p>Your acquired company stored "Company Name" in one field. You store "Account Name" with a separate "DBA Name" field. They tracked revenue in thousands. You track it in actual dollars. They have 47 custom fields for industry classification. You have a single dropdown with 12 options.</p>

        <p>These aren't just different labels. They represent fundamentally different ways of thinking about the same data. And there's no magic button that reconciles them.</p>

        <h3>Duplicate Records Everywhere</h3>
        <p>When two databases cover the same market, overlap is inevitable. The same company exists in both systems, but with slight variations: "Acme Corp" in one, "Acme Corporation, Inc." in the other. Same person, but one has their work email and the other has their personal Gmail from a conference signup three years ago.</p>

        <p>According to Gartner research, organizations that don't actively manage data quality experience 25-40% duplicate rates in their customer databases. Post-merger, that number often doubles as two sets of duplicates collide.</p>

        <h3>Conflicting Data, No Clear Winner</h3>
        <p>Here's where it gets really messy. John Smith exists in both databases. In Database A, he's the VP of Marketing at Acme Corp. In Database B, he's the CMO at Acme Corporation. Which is right? Maybe both were accurate at different times. Maybe one database has older data. Maybe he got promoted. Maybe someone made a typo.</p>

        <p>Multiply this scenario by thousands of records and you start to understand why database merges turn into six-month projects that everyone dreads.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Common Database Merge Scenarios</h2>
        <p>We've handled database merges across dozens of situations. Here are the most common triggers that bring companies to us.</p>

        <h3>Post-M&A Integration</h3>
        <p>The acquiring company and target company both have customer databases, often in different CRMs. Salesforce meets HubSpot. Or two Salesforce instances that evolved differently over years. The goal is one unified customer view, but the path there involves reconciling years of divergent data practices.</p>

        <p>M&A data integration failures are common. According to Harvard Business Review research on M&A outcomes, data integration issues are among the top reasons mergers fail to achieve expected synergies. The pressure to show quick wins often leads to rushed merges that create more problems than they solve.</p>

        <h3>Marketing + Sales Database Consolidation</h3>
        <p>Marketing built their own database in HubSpot or Marketo. Sales lives in Salesforce. For years, they've operated as parallel systems with manual syncing (or no syncing at all). Now someone decided they need a single source of truth.</p>

        <p>The challenge here isn't just technical. Marketing data tends to be broader but shallower. Sales data is deeper but narrower. Merging them means deciding which attributes matter, how to handle the massive overlap in contacts, and what to do with marketing-qualified leads that sales never touched.</p>

        <h3>Regional Database Consolidation</h3>
        <p>Global companies often end up with separate databases for each region. EMEA has their system. APAC has theirs. North America operates independently. When headquarters finally mandates consolidation, you're merging databases with different languages, different compliance requirements (GDPR anyone?), and different cultural approaches to data entry.</p>

        <h3>Legacy System Migration</h3>
        <p>You're moving from an ancient on-premise system to a modern cloud CRM. Decades of data need to come along, but the old system's data model looks nothing like the new one. Field mappings don't exist. Data types don't match. And someone has to decide which of those 200 custom fields actually matter.</p>

        <h2>The Core Challenges of Database Merging</h2>

        <h3>Field Mapping Complexity</h3>
        <p>Mapping fields between databases isn't just matching names. "Phone" in one system might map to "Business Phone" or "Mobile Phone" or "Primary Phone" in another. "Address" might be one field or five (street, city, state, zip, country). Revenue might be stored as a number, a range, or a text field with dollar signs and commas.</p>

        <p>Then there are the fields that don't map at all. One database has "Engagement Score." The other has "Lead Temperature." They're measuring similar concepts but with completely different methodologies. Do you keep both? Create a new unified field? Pick one and discard the other?</p>

        <h3>Survivorship Rules</h3>
        <p>When the same record exists in multiple databases with different values, you need rules for which value wins. This is called survivorship, and getting it wrong means your merged database inherits the worst data from both sources.</p>

        <p>Good survivorship rules are field-specific. You might trust Database A for phone numbers (they verified them recently) but Database B for job titles (they have a cleaner data entry process). Email addresses might require the most recent non-bounced value. Company data might need validation against external sources regardless of which database it came from.</p>

        <h3>Duplicate Handling at Scale</h3>
        <p>Simple deduplication matches on email address. Real-world deduplication needs to handle variations in company names, name misspellings, people who changed jobs, companies that were acquired, and contacts who exist multiple times within the same database before you even start merging.</p>

        <p>At scale, this requires probabilistic matching. Two records might be 85% likely to be the same person based on name similarity, company, and location. Do you merge them automatically? Flag them for review? The answer depends on your tolerance for false positives versus false negatives.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">Discuss Your Merge Challenges</a>
        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Handles Database Merges</h2>
        <p>We've developed a systematic approach to database merging that handles the complexity without the typical chaos.</p>

        <h3>Schema Analysis and Mapping</h3>
        <p>We start by analyzing both source databases to understand their structures, data types, and usage patterns. This isn't just looking at field names. We examine actual data values to understand what each field really contains (because "Notes" fields often hold phone numbers, and "Phone" fields often hold garbage).</p>

        <p>From there, we create a unified target schema that incorporates the best of both sources. We document every mapping decision so you understand exactly how source data becomes target data.</p>

        <h3>Intelligent Deduplication</h3>
        <p>Our deduplication process uses multiple matching strategies in layers. First pass: exact matches on email. Second pass: fuzzy matching on name + company combinations. Third pass: phone number matching. Fourth pass: probabilistic matching using machine learning on multiple attributes.</p>

        <p>For each potential duplicate pair, we calculate a confidence score. High-confidence matches merge automatically. Medium-confidence matches get human review. Low-confidence matches remain separate with a flag for future investigation.</p>

        <h3>Survivorship Implementation</h3>
        <p>Before merging any records, we establish clear survivorship rules for every field. We work with you to understand which source is more reliable for which data types. Then we implement those rules consistently across all merged records.</p>

        <p>When values conflict and there's no clear winner, we can create audit fields that preserve both values. This means you never lose data during the merge, even if it doesn't make it into the primary field.</p>

        <h3>Data Enrichment and Gap Filling</h3>
        <p>Here's where we add value beyond basic merging. Once records are deduplicated and merged, we enrich them from external sources. Missing phone numbers get filled. Outdated job titles get updated. Company data gets verified and standardized.</p>

        <p>This means your merged database isn't just unified. It's better than either source database was alone.</p>

        <h3>Human QA Throughout</h3>
        <p>Automated processes handle the volume. Human reviewers handle the edge cases. Every merge project includes manual review of flagged records, spot-checking of automated decisions, and validation of the final output before delivery.</p>

        <h2>The Database Merge Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Assessment (Free)</strong><br>
        Send us exports from your source databases. We'll analyze the schemas, estimate duplicate rates, identify potential mapping challenges, and provide a detailed scope and timeline. No obligation.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Schema Design</strong><br>
        We create your unified target schema, document all field mappings, and establish survivorship rules. You review and approve before any data transformation begins.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Deduplication</strong><br>
        We run multi-pass deduplication across and within your source databases. You receive a report of all identified duplicates with confidence scores. High-confidence matches proceed automatically. Edge cases get flagged for your review.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Merge and Transform</strong><br>
        Data from all sources gets transformed, merged, and loaded into your target schema. We maintain complete audit trails showing the origin of every field value.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Enrichment</strong><br>
        The merged database gets enriched from external sources. Missing data gets filled. Outdated data gets updated. Everything gets verified.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 6: Delivery and Validation</strong><br>
        You receive the final merged database in your preferred format, plus documentation of all transformations and a summary of merge statistics. We support you through import and validation in your target system.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <p>Database merge projects are priced based on total record volume across all source databases, schema complexity, and enrichment requirements. Most projects fall into these ranges:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Small Merges (under 50K records):</strong> $3,000 - $8,000. Simple schema alignment, standard deduplication, basic enrichment.</li>
          <li><strong>Medium Merges (50K - 250K records):</strong> $8,000 - $20,000. Complex schema mapping, multi-pass deduplication, full enrichment.</li>
          <li><strong>Enterprise Merges (250K+ records):</strong> Custom pricing. Multiple source systems, custom survivorship logic, ongoing support.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All projects include schema mapping, deduplication, survivorship rules, and basic enrichment. We provide a fixed quote after the assessment so there are no surprises.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Database Merging</h2>
        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does a database merge project typically take?</h3>
          <p>Timeline depends on database size and complexity. Simple merges of 50,000 records or fewer typically complete in 1-2 weeks. Enterprise merges involving multiple systems, complex schemas, and hundreds of thousands of records usually take 4-8 weeks. We provide a detailed timeline estimate after reviewing your specific databases.</p>

          <h3>What happens when the same person exists in both databases with different information?</h3>
          <p>We establish survivorship rules before merging. This means defining which source takes priority for each field type. For example, you might trust Database A for phone numbers but Database B for job titles. We can also create composite records that pull the best data from each source, or flag conflicts for manual review when values differ significantly.</p>

          <h3>Can you merge databases with completely different schemas?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Schema mapping is a core part of our service. We create a unified target schema, then map fields from each source database to that target. This includes handling different field names for the same data (Company vs. Organization vs. Account Name), splitting or combining fields as needed, and establishing data type conversions.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle duplicate records across the merged databases?</h3>
          <p>We use multi-layered matching that goes beyond simple email deduplication. Our process matches on email, phone, company + name combinations, and fuzzy matching for name variations. We identify duplicates, create a single golden record with the best data from each duplicate, and provide a full audit trail showing which records were merged and why.</p>
