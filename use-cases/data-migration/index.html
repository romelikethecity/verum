        <h2>The Migration Data Problem</h2>

        <p>Your company just made a big decision. You're moving to Salesforce. Or HubSpot. Or some other CRM that promises to finally get your sales data under control. The implementation partner is lined up, the budget is approved, and everyone's excited about the fresh start.</p>

        <p>Then someone asks the question nobody wants to answer: What about all the data in our current system?</p>

        <p>Here's what usually happens next. The migration team exports everything from the old system, maps the fields to the new system, and imports it all. Migration complete. Champagne. High fives.</p>

        <p>Two months later, the complaints start rolling in. Sales reps can't find their accounts. Marketing discovers 30% of their email list bounces. The CEO asks why there are three different records for their biggest customer. Support tickets pile up. User adoption stalls. That expensive new CRM everyone was excited about? It's already becoming a dumping ground for the same bad data that lived in your old system.</p>

        <p><strong>Migrating dirty data doesn't solve anything. It just moves the problem to a more expensive platform.</strong></p>

        <p>This is the migration trap that catches most companies. They focus so hard on the technology decision and the implementation that they forget about the fuel that makes the whole thing run. Your CRM is only as good as what you put into it. Import garbage, get garbage out. It really is that simple.</p>

        <h2>Common Migration Scenarios</h2>

        <p>We've worked on hundreds of CRM migrations over the years. The technology varies, but the data problems are remarkably consistent. Here are the scenarios we see most often.</p>

        <h3>Legacy CRM to Salesforce</h3>

        <p>This is the classic enterprise migration. You've been on some older system for years, maybe ACT!, GoldMine, or an early-2000s Siebel implementation that nobody remembers how to configure anymore. The data has been accumulating since before half your current employees were hired.</p>

        <p>What we find: Decades of duplicate records. Contacts who retired years ago. Companies that were acquired, merged, or went out of business. Field values that made sense to someone in 2008 but mean nothing today. Custom fields that stopped being used in 2015 but were never cleaned up.</p>

        <p>The risk: Salesforce is expensive per-seat software. Migrating bad data means your reps will lose trust in the system immediately. Salesforce adoption failures are common enough that <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/crm-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce themselves publish guidance</a> on how to avoid them. Data quality is reason number one.</p>

        <h3>Spreadsheets and Chaos to HubSpot</h3>

        <p>This is the growing company scenario. You've been running on spreadsheets, or maybe a mix of spreadsheets plus a lightweight tool that the founder signed up for five years ago. Now you're scaling and need something real.</p>

        <p>What we find: Customer data living in 17 different spreadsheets across Google Drive and Dropbox. Duplicate contacts everywhere because there was never a system of record. Inconsistent formatting. Sales has one version of a company name, marketing has another, and support has a third.</p>

        <p>The risk: HubSpot's strength is automation. But automation only works with clean, consistent data. Import messy data and your workflows will malfunction, your lead scoring will be wrong, and your sequences will go to dead addresses.</p>

        <h3>Multi-System Consolidation</h3>

        <p>This happens after acquisitions, mergers, or when departments that each bought their own CRM finally admit they need to unify. You're combining data from two, three, sometimes five different systems into one.</p>

        <p>What we find: The same companies and contacts exist in multiple systems, but with different spellings, different data, and different levels of completeness. Account hierarchies that don't match. Historical data that uses different pick-list values for the same thing.</p>

        <p>The risk: Without careful deduplication and data merging, you'll end up with duplicates of everything. Two sales reps will call the same prospect within an hour. Reports will double-count revenue. Account ownership will be a nightmare to sort out.</p>

        <h2>What Happens When You Migrate Without Cleaning First</h2>

        <p>Maybe you're thinking: we'll just clean the data after we migrate. It's easier to see what needs fixing once everything is in one place, right?</p>

        <p>Here's why that approach fails, over and over again.</p>

        <h3>User Adoption Collapses</h3>

        <p>Your team's first impression of the new CRM is that it's full of bad data. They search for an account and find three duplicates. They try to email a contact and it bounces. The phone number is wrong. The company was acquired two years ago.</p>

        <p>Within weeks, reps start building their own shadow spreadsheets again. "I can't trust the CRM" becomes the mantra. The expensive system you just implemented becomes a data entry burden instead of a selling tool. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/crm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner research</a> shows that poor user adoption is the primary reason CRM projects fail to deliver expected value.</p>

        <h3>Automation Breaks</h3>

        <p>Modern CRMs run on automation. Lead routing, email sequences, task creation, reporting. All of it depends on accurate data.</p>

        <p>Migrate dirty data and watch what happens. Leads route to the wrong reps because the industry field is blank or wrong. Email sequences go to outdated addresses and tank your sender reputation. Revenue reports are wildly inaccurate because of duplicate accounts. The automation that was supposed to save time now creates more work fixing its mistakes.</p>

        <h3>Cleanup Gets Harder, Not Easier</h3>

        <p>Here's the thing about post-migration cleanup: it requires your team to learn a new system while simultaneously fixing the data in it. That's asking a lot. People are already struggling with new workflows, new interfaces, new processes. Adding data cleanup to that burden means it never happens.</p>

        <p>The window for getting this right is before you migrate. Clean data goes in, your team trusts the system from day one, adoption succeeds.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Prepares Data for Migration</h2>

        <p>We take your export files and return import-ready data. Cleaned, deduplicated, standardized, enriched, and formatted exactly as your new CRM expects. Your team never touches the messy part.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across Sources</h3>

        <p>Whether you're cleaning one CRM or consolidating five, we identify duplicates using fuzzy matching on company names, domains, email patterns, and contact information. "Acme Corp" and "ACME Corporation Inc" become one record. "John Smith at acme.com" and "J. Smith at acmecorp.com" get flagged as potential matches.</p>

        <p>You decide the merge rules. Which system is the source of truth for which fields? How do you want conflicts resolved? We execute the deduplication according to your business logic, with full transparency on what merged with what.</p>

        <h3>Data Standardization</h3>

        <p>We normalize everything. Phone numbers get consistent formatting. State names become standard abbreviations. Company names get proper capitalization. Industry classifications align with your target CRM's pick-list values.</p>

        <p>We also handle the field mapping that makes migration teams tear their hair out. Your old CRM had "Company Name" and the new one expects "Account Name"? No problem. Different field structures, different required fields, different data types. We translate between systems so your import files just work.</p>

        <h3>Data Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Most CRM data is incomplete. Missing phone numbers. Empty industry fields. Contacts without job titles. Records that are technically valid but useless for actually selling.</p>

        <p>We fill in the gaps using 50+ data sources. Add missing firmographics like company size, revenue range, and industry. Verify and update contact information. Append enrichment data you've never had, like tech stack signals or funding status. Your new CRM starts with complete records, not the partial data you've been working around for years.</p>

        <h3>Validation and Verification</h3>

        <p>We verify email addresses at the mailbox level. Not just syntax checking, but actual deliverability testing. Bounce rates above 2% hurt your sender reputation. We make sure you're not importing a list of dead addresses.</p>

        <p>Phone numbers get validated too. Disconnected numbers flagged. Mobile vs. landline identified. International formats standardized.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Everything</h3>

        <p>AI handles the heavy lifting. But every file gets human review before delivery. We catch the edge cases that automated systems miss. The unusual company structures. The ambiguous matches. The data that looks right but isn't.</p>

        <h2>Process and Timeline</h2>

        <p>Migration data prep doesn't need to add months to your project timeline. Most engagements complete in 1-2 weeks.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data Export</strong><br>
        Pull your records from your current CRM or source systems. CSV, Excel, whatever format exports cleanly. If you're consolidating multiple systems, export from each one.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Scoping Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We review your data, understand your new CRM's requirements, and define the cleaning rules together. What constitutes a duplicate? Which source wins for field conflicts? What enrichment data would make the biggest difference?</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Processing</strong><br>
        We clean, dedupe, validate, standardize, and enrich. Most datasets process in 24-48 hours. Complex consolidations may take a few days longer.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Review and Iteration</strong><br>
        You validate a sample of the cleaned data. We adjust anything that doesn't look right. This usually takes one round, occasionally two for complex projects.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery</strong><br>
        Import-ready files formatted exactly as your new CRM expects them. Headers matched. Data types correct. Ready to upload and go live with clean data from day one.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 1-2 weeks from data handoff to delivery. For complex multi-system consolidations, allow 2-3 weeks.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Migration data prep is project-based pricing. No subscriptions, no recurring fees, no per-seat licensing.</p>

        <p><strong>Simple single-source cleanups:</strong> $2,000-$5,000<br>
        One CRM or database, straightforward deduplication and validation, basic enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Standard migrations:</strong> $5,000-$10,000<br>
        Single source with extensive enrichment, or two systems being consolidated. Includes deduplication, standardization, validation, and enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Complex consolidations:</strong> $8,000-$15,000<br>
        Three or more source systems, extensive deduplication across sources, complex merge logic, full enrichment.</p>

        <p>Compare those numbers to the cost of a failed CRM implementation. The average Salesforce implementation runs $50,000-$150,000. If your migration fails because of data quality, you're not just wasting that investment. You're also dealing with lost productivity, user adoption problems, and eventually starting over.</p>

        <p>Spending $5,000 to prep the data before migration is the cheapest insurance you can buy.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why should I clean data before migration instead of after?</h3>
          <p>Cleaning data before migration is significantly easier and cheaper than cleaning it after. Post-migration cleanup requires your team to learn a new system while simultaneously fixing data problems. That kills user adoption. Gartner research shows organizations that clean data pre-migration see 40% faster time-to-value from their new CRM. Clean data in means clean data out.</p>

          <h3>How long does migration data preparation take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 1-2 weeks from data handoff to delivery. The actual cleaning and enrichment typically takes 24-48 hours. Planning, validation, and iteration add time but not much. For complex consolidations involving multiple source systems, allow 2-3 weeks.</p>

          <h3>Can you help with Salesforce and HubSpot migrations specifically?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Salesforce and HubSpot are our most common migration targets. We understand both platforms' data models, required fields, and import formats. We'll deliver files structured exactly as your new CRM expects, so import goes smoothly. We've also worked with Dynamics 365, Pipedrive, Zoho, and custom systems.</p>

          <h3>What if our data is really bad?</h3>
          <p>We've seen it all. CRMs with 50% duplicate rates. Contact lists where half the people left their companies years ago. Data that hasn't been cleaned since 2015. The worse your data is, the more value you'll see from cleaning it before migration. We start with a free assessment so you know exactly what you're dealing with.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Migrate With Confidence?</h2>

        <p>Two paths forward:</p>

        <p><strong>Still planning?</strong> Tell us about your migration timeline and data challenges. We'll give you an honest assessment of what needs to happen before cutover.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to prep?</strong> Send us a sample export. We'll clean a subset and show you the before-and-after so you can see exactly what you're getting.</p>
