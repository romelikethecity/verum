        <h2>The Franchise Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You're trying to sell to franchise owners. Maybe you sell POS systems, commercial cleaning, payroll services, or insurance. You know there are 790,000+ franchise establishments in the US. Great market. Obvious opportunity.</p>

        <p>Then you try to build a list.</p>

        <p>You pull data from a standard B2B database. You get records for "McDonald's" and "Subway" and "Planet Fitness." But which McDonald's? The corporate-owned flagship in Chicago, or the franchisee-owned location in suburban Ohio? Your data provider doesn't know. Neither does Google. And if you call corporate, they'll tell you they don't share franchisee contact information.</p>

        <p>This is the franchise prospecting problem. The brand is easy to find. The actual decision-maker is hidden behind layers of corporate structures, LLCs, area development agreements, and ownership complexity that most data providers can't untangle.</p>

        <h3>Franchisees vs Corporate: Two Different Sales</h3>

        <p>When you call a corporate-owned location, you're selling to a publicly traded company with procurement departments, RFP processes, and 18-month sales cycles. When you call a franchisee, you're selling to a small business owner who can make a decision this week.</p>

        <p>According to the International Franchise Association, approximately 44% of all franchise units are now owned by multi-unit operators. These owners run 5, 10, sometimes 50+ locations under the same ownership entity. They're not listed in your CRM as "multi-unit operators." They're listed as individual locations with no connection between them.</p>

        <p>That Planet Fitness in Denver and the one in Phoenix? Same owner. Different records in your database. Your reps are calling both locations, not realizing they're pitching the same person twice.</p>

        <h3>The Ownership Structure Problem</h3>

        <p>Franchise ownership is complicated. A single franchise location might be owned by an LLC that's owned by a holding company that's owned by three partners, one of whom is the operating partner who actually makes vendor decisions.</p>

        <p>Standard B2B databases list the registered agent. The registered agent is usually a lawyer or a corporate services company. Not very useful when you're trying to reach the person who buys payroll software.</p>

        <p>Area developers add another layer. In many franchise systems, area developers own the rights to develop an entire region. They might own some locations directly, sell franchises to other operators, and collect royalties from sub-franchisees. Who makes the purchasing decision? It depends on the contract, the category, and sometimes the mood of the parties involved.</p>

        <h3>The Multi-Brand Complexity</h3>

        <p>Experienced franchise operators rarely stop at one brand. The owner of 15 Dunkin' locations might also own 8 Baskin-Robbins stores, 4 Massage Envy spas, and 3 Great Clips salons. Different brands, same owner, same purchasing authority.</p>

        <p>If you're selling commercial insurance, you want to know this. One conversation could cover 30 locations instead of one. But your database shows 30 separate records with different ownership fields because each brand uses a different LLC.</p>

        <p>Connecting these records requires research that most sales teams don't have time for. So they don't. They call each location individually, never realizing they're competing against themselves for the same buyer's attention.</p>

        <h2>Why Franchise Prospecting Is Hard</h2>

        <p>Most B2B data providers built their systems for traditional companies. One company, one headquarters, one set of decision-makers. Franchises don't work that way, and the data infrastructure hasn't caught up.</p>

        <h3>Identifying the Real Decision-Maker</h3>

        <p>The person who answers the phone at a franchise location is almost never the person who buys enterprise services. The general manager at a McDonald's doesn't choose the payroll provider. The shift supervisor at Jiffy Lube doesn't select the accounting software.</p>

        <p>You need the franchisee. The person whose name is on the franchise agreement. The one who writes the checks and makes the vendor decisions. That person might work at the location, might work from a home office, might have a completely separate business address for their franchise holding company.</p>

        <p>Finding them requires going beyond the basic business listing. It requires state business filings, franchise disclosure documents, and verification that the person you found is still the current owner. Franchise ownership changes hands more often than you'd think. The IFA estimates annual ownership transitions affect roughly 30% of franchise locations through sales, transfers, and closures.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Purchasing Authority</h3>

        <p>Even when you find the franchise owner, purchasing authority varies wildly by category and franchise system. Some franchisors mandate specific vendors for certain services. Others give franchisees complete discretion. Many fall somewhere in between.</p>

        <p>If you're selling something the franchisor has already contracted, you're wasting your time. If you're selling something the franchisee can choose independently, you need to talk to them directly. Knowing the difference before you call saves hours of misdirected outreach.</p>

        <h3>Data Decay in the Franchise Sector</h3>

        <p>Contact data decays at roughly 30% per year in general B2B contexts. In franchising, it's often worse. Franchise agreements expire. Locations close. Ownership transfers happen. Operators expand into new territories and consolidate existing ones.</p>

        <p>That list of Planet Fitness owners you bought six months ago? A meaningful percentage of those records are already wrong. Not because the data provider lied, but because the franchise sector moves fast and most data providers don't refresh their franchise data frequently enough to keep up.</p>

        <h2>Franchise Prospecting Use Cases</h2>

        <p>Different teams need franchise data for different reasons. The quality requirements are similar, but the specific data points matter more or less depending on what you're trying to accomplish.</p>

        <h3>Selling to Franchise Owners</h3>

        <p>If you sell products or services to franchise businesses, you need three things: the right contact, verified ownership, and some indicator of purchasing potential.</p>

        <p>The right contact means the franchisee or their designated operations manager, not the corporate brand and not the location's general manager. Verified ownership means confirmed against recent business filings, not just pulled from a database that was last updated 18 months ago.</p>

        <p>Purchasing potential varies by what you sell. For payroll services, you care about employee count. For commercial insurance, you care about location count and revenue. For POS systems, you care about current tech stack and contract renewal timing. We can enrich for any of these.</p>

        <h3>Franchise Development</h3>

        <p>If you're a franchisor looking to expand, or a franchise broker trying to match buyers with opportunities, you need data on potential franchisees.</p>

        <p>The best franchise candidates are often existing franchisees looking to add brands. They already understand the model. They have the operational infrastructure. They have access to capital. Identifying which multi-unit operators are actively expanding, which ones have recently sold locations, and which ones might be receptive to adding a complementary brand requires a different kind of data than basic contact enrichment.</p>

        <h3>Vendor Sales to the Franchise Sector</h3>

        <p>Large vendors selling to the franchise sector often need to approach both corporate and franchisees. A restaurant equipment company might pitch corporate for an approved vendor designation, then sell directly to individual franchisees.</p>

        <p>This requires understanding the franchise system's structure. Which categories are mandated? Which are suggested? Which are completely discretionary? We can research and document these structures as part of your franchise data project.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How Verum Solves Franchise Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>We've built processes specifically for franchise prospecting because generic B2B data enrichment doesn't work for this sector. Here's what we do differently.</p>

        <h3>Franchise Owner Identification</h3>

        <p>We identify the actual franchisee behind each location. Not the brand. Not the registered agent. The person or entity that owns the franchise agreement and makes vendor decisions.</p>

        <p>This involves pulling state business filings, cross-referencing multiple ownership databases, and verifying that the ownership data is current. We flag any locations where ownership is unclear or recently changed so you know which records need extra verification before outreach.</p>

        <h3>Location Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Every franchise location gets enriched with relevant business data: employee count estimates, revenue indicators, years in operation, and verification of active status. We also capture physical address standardization so your location-based targeting actually works.</p>

        <p>For multi-unit operators, we link all their locations together under a unified ownership record. Your reps can see at a glance whether they're calling a single-location owner or someone who runs 47 locations across three states.</p>

        <h3>Corporate vs Franchisee Classification</h3>

        <p>Every record gets classified as franchisee-owned, corporate-owned, or area developer-owned. We include confidence scoring so you can filter for high-confidence records when precision matters, or include medium-confidence records when coverage is the priority.</p>

        <p>For brands with significant corporate-owned presence (many QSR chains fall into this category), this classification alone can eliminate 30-40% of wasted outreach to locations where individual sales calls won't work.</p>

        <h3>Contact Verification and Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Once we identify the owner, we find their contact information. Direct email, phone number, LinkedIn profile, business address. Every email gets deliverability verification. Every phone number gets validated.</p>

        <p>We guarantee 93% email deliverability on all franchise owner data. Human QA reviews every record before delivery. If we can't verify a contact meets our quality standards, we don't include it in your file.</p>

        <h2>Our Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Define your target franchise profile.</strong> Which brands? Which geographies? Multi-unit operators only, or all franchisees? Corporate-owned included or excluded? We'll help you define criteria that balances coverage with relevance.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We build your initial list.</strong> Using franchise directories, state filings, and our proprietary ownership database, we compile locations matching your criteria. You'll see a sample before we proceed to full enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Ownership verification.</strong> Each location gets researched to identify current ownership. We link multi-unit operators across their entire portfolio and classify each location by ownership type.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Contact enrichment.</strong> For each verified owner, we find and verify contact information. Direct email, phone, LinkedIn, business address. Everything gets checked against deliverability standards.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery and integration.</strong> You receive clean, enriched data in your preferred format. CSV, direct CRM import, or API delivery. Ongoing refresh available if you need it.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Franchise list building and enrichment starts at $0.15-0.35 per verified owner record, depending on the depth of enrichment required and the complexity of the franchise systems involved.</p>

        <p>Multi-unit operator identification and portfolio linking adds complexity but is included in most projects. Custom research on franchise system purchasing structures is quoted separately based on scope.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $1,000. Most franchise prospecting projects run $2,500-$7,500 depending on list size and enrichment depth. We provide fixed quotes after reviewing your requirements.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you identify franchise owners versus corporate-owned locations?</h3>
          <p>We use a combination of state business filings, FDD (Franchise Disclosure Document) data, corporate registry lookups, and ownership verification through multiple sources. Each location is classified as franchisee-owned, corporate-owned, or area developer-owned with confidence scoring.</p>

          <h3>Can you build lists of multi-unit franchise owners?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We specialize in identifying multi-unit operators who own 5, 10, 50+ locations across one or multiple brands. These are often the highest-value prospects for B2B vendors because they make centralized purchasing decisions. We link all their locations together in the delivered data so you can see the complete portfolio.</p>

          <h3>What franchise brands do you cover?</h3>
          <p>We cover all major franchise systems in the US including QSR (McDonald's, Subway, Chick-fil-A), fitness (Planet Fitness, Orangetheory), automotive (Jiffy Lube, Midas), home services (ServPro, The UPS Store), and hundreds more. If it's in the IFA directory, we can build you a list. For less common franchise systems, we may need additional time for research.</p>

          <h3>How accurate is franchise owner contact data?</h3>
          <p>We guarantee 93% email deliverability on all franchise owner data. Every record goes through human QA verification. Franchise ownership changes frequently, so we verify each contact against current state filings and business registrations before delivery. If we can't verify to our standards, we don't include the record.</p>
