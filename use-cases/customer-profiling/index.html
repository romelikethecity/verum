        <h2>The Customer Profiling Problem</h2>

        <p>You know the feeling. You pull a list of your top 500 customers to analyze buying patterns, and half the records have nothing but a name and email. No company size. No industry. No information about what they actually do or why they bought from you.</p>

        <p>This isn't a minor inconvenience. It's a fundamental problem that breaks everything downstream: segmentation, personalization, expansion campaigns, churn prediction. All of it depends on knowing who your customers actually are. And most companies don't.</p>

        <h3>The Data You're Working With Is Sparse</h3>

        <p>The average CRM record has maybe 30% of the fields filled in. Reps enter the bare minimum to log the deal. Marketing captures what the form asked for. Nobody goes back to add company size, tech stack, or the dozen other fields that would make the record useful.</p>

        <p>So you end up with customer profiles that look like this: name, email, company name, maybe a phone number. That's it. Not exactly the foundation for data-driven decision making.</p>

        <h3>What You Do Have Is Probably Wrong</h3>

        <p>Here's what makes it worse. The data you do have decays constantly. People change jobs. Companies get acquired. Titles evolve. That "VP of Marketing" who signed the deal two years ago? They might be a CMO somewhere else now. Or they left the workforce entirely. Or the company rebranded and the domain doesn't even exist anymore.</p>

        <p>Industry research consistently shows that B2B contact data decays at roughly 25-30% per year. Your customer database isn't static. It's actively getting worse every month you don't maintain it.</p>

        <h3>Manual Profiling Doesn't Scale</h3>

        <p>Some teams try to solve this by manually researching customers. An SDR spends 20 minutes on LinkedIn piecing together a company profile before a call. A marketing ops person spends a week researching accounts for an ABM campaign.</p>

        <p>That works for maybe 50 accounts. It doesn't work for 5,000. And it definitely doesn't work for the ongoing maintenance you need to keep profiles accurate over time.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Why Customer Profiles Break Down</h2>

        <p>Understanding why profiles become incomplete helps you fix the problem at its root. Three forces constantly degrade your customer data.</p>

        <h3>Contact-Level Decay</h3>

        <p>The people in your CRM don't stay still. The average tenure for a B2B buyer is around 2-3 years. That means roughly a third of your contacts will change jobs, get promoted, or move to different companies in any given year. Your "customer" contact at Company X might now be a prospect at Company Y. Or they might have left the industry entirely.</p>

        <p>Every job change breaks the link between your historical data and your current customer. Unless you're actively tracking these movements, your profile of that account becomes stale the moment the key contact walks out the door.</p>

        <h3>Company-Level Changes</h3>

        <p>Companies change too. Startups get acquired. Enterprises spin off divisions. Private companies go public. Public companies go private. A company you sold to in 2022 might not exist as a separate entity in 2025.</p>

        <p>Company-level data like employee count, revenue, and industry classification also shifts. That 50-person startup is now a 200-person scale-up. Your "SMB" customer is now mid-market. These changes affect segmentation, pricing, and expansion strategy. If you're not updating company-level data, you're making decisions based on a snapshot that's years out of date.</p>

        <h3>Technology and Operational Changes</h3>

        <p>The tools companies use evolve constantly. That customer running Salesforce might have migrated to HubSpot. The one using your competitor's product might have churned from them too. Tech stack data, in particular, has a short half-life. If you're using technographic data for targeting or competitive intelligence, you need to refresh it regularly or you're working with fiction.</p>

        <h2>What Complete Customer Profiles Enable</h2>

        <p>When you actually know who your customers are, everything gets easier. Here's what becomes possible with enriched, complete profiles.</p>

        <h3>Real Segmentation</h3>

        <p>Segmentation requires data. You can't segment by company size if you don't know company size. You can't segment by industry if half your records say "Other" or are blank entirely.</p>

        <p>Complete profiles let you create segments that actually mean something: enterprise healthcare companies using Salesforce, mid-market fintech startups in growth mode, SMBs in manufacturing with legacy ERP systems. These segments drive strategy. "Companies that bought something" doesn't.</p>

        <h3>Personalization at Scale</h3>

        <p>Personalization requires context. When you know a customer's industry, company stage, tech stack, and the seniority of your contacts, you can tailor messaging in ways that actually resonate.</p>

        <p>This isn't about mail-merge tricks with first names. It's about understanding that a CFO at a 50-person startup has different priorities than a CFO at a 5,000-person enterprise. Complete profiles make that distinction possible across thousands of customers.</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Cross-Sell Targeting</h3>

        <p>Your best expansion opportunities aren't random. They share characteristics: company size, growth trajectory, tech stack compatibility, multiple stakeholders at different levels. With enriched profiles, you can identify which customers look like your best expansion candidates and prioritize accordingly.</p>

        <p>Without that data, you're guessing. Or worse, you're treating every customer the same regardless of their expansion potential.</p>

        <h3>Churn Prediction and Prevention</h3>

        <p>Customer profiles feed churn models. Knowing that a key champion just left the company is an early warning sign. Knowing that a customer's company just got acquired means you need to re-qualify the account. These signals require complete, current data to detect.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Enriches Customer Profiles</h2>

        <p>We take your existing customer list and add the data that's missing. No software to implement. No integration to maintain. Send us a file, get back enriched profiles.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Company-level data that tells you who you're actually selling to: employee count, revenue range, industry classification, company type, founding date, headquarters location, number of locations. We pull from 50+ sources and cross-reference to ensure accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>For customer profiling:</strong> Firmographics are the foundation. You can't segment or analyze customers without knowing basic facts about their companies. We fill in these gaps so your profiles are actually usable.</p>

        <h3>Demographic Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Contact-level data that tells you who you're talking to: job title (normalized), department, seniority level, years in role, LinkedIn profile, professional background. This turns a name and email into an actual person you can understand.</p>

        <p><strong>For customer profiling:</strong> Knowing that your buyer is a "Director" vs a "VP" vs a "C-level" changes how you engage them. We add the context that makes personalization possible.</p>

        <h3>Technographic Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Technology stack data: what CRM they use, what marketing automation platform, what analytics tools, what infrastructure. This is critical for targeting, competitive intelligence, and understanding integration needs.</p>

        <p><strong>For customer profiling:</strong> Tech stack often correlates with sophistication, budget, and specific use cases. A customer running enterprise Salesforce has different needs than one on HubSpot Starter.</p>

        <h3>Social and Web Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Social profiles, company website data, news mentions, funding history, recent press. This adds qualitative context that pure firmographics miss.</p>

        <p><strong>For customer profiling:</strong> A customer that just raised a Series B is in a different mode than one that's been bootstrapped for 10 years. Funding data, news, and social signals add that dimension.</p>

        <h3>Human QA on Every Record</h3>

        <p>Automated enrichment makes mistakes. We catch them. Every enriched record goes through human quality assurance before delivery. We verify matches, flag anomalies, and ensure the data we send back is accurate. This is the difference between "enriched" and "actually usable."</p>

        <h2>The Process: From Sparse to Complete</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send Us Your Customer List (5 minutes)</strong><br>
        Export from your CRM or send us a spreadsheet. We accept any format. No special formatting required.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We Analyze What's Missing (24 hours)</strong><br>
        We profile your data to identify gaps, assess match rates, and create an enrichment plan. This analysis is free.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment Begins</strong><br>
        We run your records through our enrichment pipeline, pulling data from 50+ sources, cross-referencing for accuracy, and building complete profiles.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA</strong><br>
        Our team reviews enriched records, verifies matches, and flags anything that looks off. This catches the errors that pure automation misses.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery (24-48 hours)</strong><br>
        You receive enriched profiles in your preferred format. CSV, direct CRM import, or whatever works for your workflow.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 6: Ongoing Maintenance (Optional)</strong><br>
        Customer data decays. We can refresh your profiles quarterly, monthly, or on whatever cadence makes sense for your business.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>We charge per record, not per seat or per year. You pay for what you use.</p>

        <p><strong>Basic Enrichment:</strong> Starting at $0.10/record for core firmographic and demographic data.</p>

        <p><strong>Full Enrichment:</strong> $0.25-0.50/record for comprehensive profiles including technographics, social data, and intent signals.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing Maintenance:</strong> Monthly or quarterly refresh pricing available based on volume and frequency.</p>

        <p>No annual contracts. No platform fees. No seat licenses. Data you enrich is yours to keep forever.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Customer Profile Enrichment</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How long does enrichment take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 24-48 hours. Larger datasets (100K+ records) may take 3-5 business days. We'll give you a timeline upfront based on your specific data.</p>

          <h3>What data fields can you add to customer profiles?</h3>
          <p>Company data: employee count, revenue, industry, location, founding date, company type, number of locations. Contact data: job title (normalized), department, seniority, LinkedIn profile. Tech stack: CRM, marketing automation, analytics tools, infrastructure. Plus social profiles, funding data, and news mentions.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from ZoomInfo or similar tools?</h3>
          <p>Three fundamental differences. First, ZoomInfo sells net-new contacts. We enrich your existing customer data. Different use case entirely. Second, ZoomInfo costs $15K-50K+ per year. We charge per project, so you're not paying for data you don't use. Third, when you cancel ZoomInfo, you have to delete the data. Enriched data from Verum is yours forever.</p>

          <h3>What if my customer records have errors or are incomplete?</h3>
          <p>We handle that. Our process starts with data cleaning: standardizing company names, validating emails, normalizing job titles, fixing formatting issues. Clean data enriches better. We don't just bolt new data onto broken records.</p>

          <h3>Can you enrich records with just a company name or email?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We can match and enrich from minimal inputs. A company name gets you firmographics. An email domain gets you company data. A full contact record gets you everything. Match rates vary based on input quality, but we can work with what you have.</p>

          <h3>How do you ensure data accuracy?</h3>
          <p>Three layers. First, we pull from 50+ sources and cross-reference conflicting data. Second, automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., a "startup" with 10,000 employees). Third, human QA reviews every batch before delivery. We guarantee 93% accuracy or we re-enrich at no cost.</p>
