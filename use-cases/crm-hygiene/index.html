        <h2>What CRM Hygiene Actually Looks Like</h2>

        <p>A $950M medical device company came to us with a problem. They'd acquired contact data from five different vendors over the years. Each vendor had their own format, their own column names, their own way of storing phone numbers and emails.</p>

        <p>The result was 120,000+ contact records spread across six states. Seventy different column names trying to describe the same 22 pieces of information. "BUSINESS NAME" in one file. "Business Name" in another. "business name" in a third. One vendor's column was labeled "Fuell Enrich Email" because someone made a typo that became permanent.</p>

        <p>Phone numbers were losing their first digit during formatting. Thousands of records with numbers that just wouldn't dial. Their sales team had stopped trusting the data entirely. When reps don't trust the CRM, they stop using it.</p>

        <h3>What we cleaned</h3>

        <p>Smart column mapping that handled all 70+ variations and consolidated them down to 22 clean, standardized fields. The mapping worked case-insensitively and used fuzzy matching to catch typos and inconsistencies.</p>

        <p>A multi-phase deduplication algorithm. Exact matching for the straightforward stuff. Fuzzy matching for company name variations like "Acme Corp" versus "Acme Corporation" versus "ACME Co." LinkedIn URL normalization so different profile formats stopped looking like different people.</p>

        <p>Cell-level validation that caught the phone corruption issue before it shipped. Every record verified against formatting rules and deliverability checks.</p>

        <h3>The results</h3>

        <p>What would have taken a contractor 60 weeks, we completed in days. That's $120,000+ in labor costs they didn't spend. More importantly, the phone number corruption alone would have cost them an estimated $600,000 in missed opportunities.</p>

        <p>We caught it before it shipped.</p>

        <h2>The CRM Hygiene Problem</h2>

        <p>Every CRM accumulates problems. It's not anyone's fault. Data just decays.</p>

        <p>People change jobs. Companies get acquired. Email addresses stop working. Phone numbers go stale. And meanwhile, your team keeps adding new records on top of the old ones. Different reps entering the same company three different ways.</p>

        <p>The research backs this up. According to Validity's 2024 State of CRM Data report, sales reps spend an average of 13 hours per week just hunting for information in their CRM. That's a third of their selling time lost to data problems.</p>

        <p>And contact data decays at roughly 30% per year. That email address you verified last January has a one-in-three chance of bouncing today.</p>

        <h2>What We Clean</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Duplicate detection and merge.</strong> Not just exact matches. We use fuzzy matching to catch "Acme Corp" versus "Acme Corporation" versus "ACME Co." and merge them while preserving the best data from each record.</li>

          <li><strong>Email validation.</strong> We check deliverability, not just format. A properly formatted email that bounces is worse than useless because it damages your sender reputation.</li>

          <li><strong>Phone standardization.</strong> Everything converted to consistent format. We catch corrupted numbers, strip invalid characters, and flag numbers that don't match expected patterns.</li>

          <li><strong>Contact normalization.</strong> Job titles standardized. Company names cleaned. Addresses formatted consistently. Your segmentation and routing rules actually work.</li>

          <li><strong>Field standardization.</strong> State abbreviations, country codes, date formats. All the little inconsistencies that break your automation and make reporting unreliable.</li>

          <li><strong>Stale record identification.</strong> We flag contacts who've changed jobs, companies that have been acquired, and records that haven't been touched in years. You decide what to do with them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your CRM data.</strong> Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, Pipedrive. Whatever you use. We work with any format you can export.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and provide a cleaning plan.</strong> Before we touch anything, you'll know exactly what we're going to do. What duplicates we've identified. What fields we'll standardize. What issues we found.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: AI processing + human QA.</strong> Automation handles the scale. Humans handle the judgment calls. Every project gets both.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: You get clean data back.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to import. Or we can push directly to your CRM if you prefer.</p>
