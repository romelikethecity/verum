<h2>Email Marketing Cleanup</h2>
<p>Email marketing cleanup removes the records from your marketing database that are hurting your performance: invalid emails, duplicate contacts, spam traps, role-based addresses, and disengaged subscribers. Every bad record in your list drags down deliverability and inflates your costs.</p>

<p>You're paying your ESP for 50,000 contacts but only 30,000 are real, engaged people. The other 20,000 are bounced addresses, duplicates, spam traps, and people who haven't opened an email in two years. They're costing you money every month and damaging your sender reputation with every send.</p>

<h2>What We Clean From Marketing Lists</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Email verification.</strong> Every address gets validated for deliverability. Hard bounces, defunct domains, and nonexistent mailboxes get removed.</li>
    <li><strong>Spam trap removal.</strong> Known spam trap addresses that ISPs use to catch senders with dirty lists get identified and removed before they damage your reputation.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate removal.</strong> The same person receiving your email three times isn't engagement — it's annoyance. We deduplicate across email variants and typo corrections.</li>
    <li><strong>Role address filtering.</strong> info@, sales@, team@ addresses that never convert get flagged for removal or separate treatment.</li>
    <li><strong>Engagement analysis.</strong> Contacts who haven't opened or clicked in 12+ months get flagged as candidates for re-engagement campaigns or removal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clean Marketing List Benefits</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lower ESP costs because you're only paying for contacts who can actually receive your emails</li>
    <li>Better deliverability because your sender reputation improves when bounce rates drop</li>
    <li>More accurate marketing metrics because opens and clicks are measured against a real audience</li>
    <li>Higher engagement rates because inactive contacts aren't diluting your performance numbers</li>
    <li>Compliance with email regulations because suppressions and opt-outs are properly handled</li>
</ul>
