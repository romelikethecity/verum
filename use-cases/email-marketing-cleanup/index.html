        <h2>The Email Marketing Cleanup Problem</h2>

        <p>You build a campaign. Craft the subject line. Design the template. Write copy that actually sounds human. Then you hit send to 50,000 contacts and watch the metrics roll in.</p>

        <p>8% bounce rate. Your ESP starts throttling delivery. Half your list never sees the email because your sender reputation just took another hit.</p>

        <p>Email databases decay constantly. People change jobs. Companies get acquired. Domains expire. That list you built over three years doesn't have 50,000 valid emails anymore. It might have 35,000. The rest are actively hurting you every time you send.</p>

        <p>A medical device company we worked with had accumulated 120,000+ contact records over years of trade shows, webinars, and content downloads. They knew the data wasn't pristine, but they didn't know how bad it had gotten.</p>

        <h3>What we discovered</h3>

        <p>Five different data vendors had touched their database over the years. BetterContact, Clay, FullEnrich, FastPeople, ZoomInfo. Each had added records with slightly different formatting conventions. Email addresses with extra spaces. Domains with typos that had been copy-pasted thousands of times. Role-based addresses like info@ and sales@ mixed in with personal contacts.</p>

        <p>We found duplicate contacts with slightly different email variations. The same person appearing three times because one record had firstname.lastname@company.com, another had flastname@company.com, and a third had a personal Gmail they'd used at a trade show.</p>

        <p>Their deliverability had been declining for months. They blamed the content, the timing, the ESP. The actual problem was simpler: they were sending to addresses that didn't exist anymore.</p>

        <h2>What We Clean for Email Marketing</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Deliverability validation.</strong> Not just format checking. We verify the mailbox actually exists and accepts mail. Hard bounces get flagged before they damage your reputation.</li>

          <li><strong>Duplicate detection.</strong> Exact matches and fuzzy matches. firstname.lastname@ versus f.lastname@ versus flastname@. We find the variations and merge them correctly.</li>

          <li><strong>Typo domain correction.</strong> gamil.com, gmial.com, gmal.com. We've seen them all. These get corrected before they become permanent bounces in your system.</li>

          <li><strong>Role-based address flagging.</strong> info@, sales@, support@, team@. These often go to shared inboxes or nowhere at all. We flag them so you can decide whether to include them.</li>

          <li><strong>Spam trap detection.</strong> Sending to known spam traps is the fastest way to get blacklisted. We check against trap databases and flag high-risk addresses.</li>

          <li><strong>Syntax standardization.</strong> Trailing spaces, leading spaces, mixed case, special characters. Small formatting issues that cause delivery failures get fixed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Export your email list.</strong> From your ESP, CRM, or marketing automation platform. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze current health.</strong> Before cleaning anything, you'll see exactly how much decay exists. Bounce rate estimates. Duplicate counts. Risk categories.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Validation against multiple sources.</strong> We check each email against deliverability databases, spam trap lists, and SMTP verification. Multiple signals, not just one check.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human review of edge cases.</strong> Automation handles the obvious stuff. Humans review the judgment calls. Emails that look valid but have subtle issues. Duplicates that could be different people.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Clean list returned.</strong> Same format you sent. Clear flags for each issue found. Ready to import back into your ESP or suppress the bad addresses.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Email list cleaning runs $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on list size and which validation checks you need. Basic deliverability validation is at the lower end. Full cleaning with deduplication and enrichment is higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after analyzing your list.</p>
