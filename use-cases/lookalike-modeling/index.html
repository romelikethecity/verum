        <h2>The Lookalike Modeling Problem: Garbage In, Garbage Out</h2>

        <p>You have 100 of your best customers. You want to find 10,000 more companies just like them. Simple enough in theory. Export your customer list, run it through a lookalike tool, get a list of similar accounts. Except it never works that cleanly.</p>

        <p>The problem starts before you even build the model. Your seed list has company names, maybe industry, maybe employee count if someone bothered to fill it in. Half the records are missing revenue data. A third don't have technology information. Industry classifications are inconsistent at best.</p>

        <p>Now you ask an algorithm to find "similar" companies. Similar how? Based on what attributes? If your seed accounts only have complete data for 3 out of 15 relevant dimensions, the model can only match on those 3 dimensions. The other 12 are invisible.</p>

        <p>This is the fundamental problem with lookalike modeling in B2B. You're asking the model to find patterns in data that doesn't exist. According to Gartner, B2B marketing teams waste an estimated 27% of their data and analytics budget on poor data quality alone.<sup>1</sup> When that flawed data feeds your targeting models, the waste compounds.</p>

        <h3>You can't model on incomplete profiles</h3>

        <p>Consider what happens when you try to build a lookalike audience with typical CRM data. Your 100 seed accounts might have these fill rates: company name (100%), industry (78%), employee count (61%), revenue (34%), technology stack (12%), funding stage (8%), growth rate (3%).</p>

        <p>What does "similar" mean when 88% of records are missing tech stack data? The model ignores technographics entirely because there's nothing to model on. If tech stack is actually your most predictive attribute (it often is for software companies), you've just built a lookalike on irrelevant dimensions while ignoring the one that matters.</p>

        <h3>Modeling on the wrong attributes</h3>

        <p>Even when data exists, it might not be the right data. Most lookalike tools default to matching on industry and company size because that's what's available. But are those actually the attributes that predict success with your product?</p>

        <p>We've seen companies discover their best customers share technology stack patterns, not industry patterns. Or growth trajectory matters more than current size. Or geographic density predicts success better than revenue. These insights only emerge when you have the data to test against.</p>

        <p>According to TOPO research, companies with data-driven targeting see 3x higher conversion rates compared to those using intuition-based segmentation.<sup>2</sup> But data-driven targeting requires having the right data in the first place.</p>

        <h3>The consequences compound</h3>

        <p>Poor lookalike models create cascading problems. Your ABM campaigns target the wrong accounts. Your SDRs waste time on companies that were never going to buy. Your marketing qualified accounts look nothing like the accounts that actually close. And when leadership asks why account-based programs aren't delivering, the answer is hidden in your data quality.</p>

        <p>Demandbase found that 68% of ABM campaigns fail to reach their intended ICP targets.<sup>3</sup> The campaigns aren't the problem. The targeting is. And the targeting is broken because the underlying data doesn't support it.</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">Assess My Seed List Quality</a>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Most B2B Lookalike Models Fail</h2>

        <p>After enriching seed lists for dozens of companies, we see the same patterns. The model didn't fail because the algorithm was bad. It failed because the inputs were inadequate.</p>

        <h3>Incomplete seed profiles</h3>

        <p>Your best customers are your signal. If those profiles are incomplete, you're telling the model to find companies that match... partial information. The model obeys. It finds companies that match the incomplete dimensions you provided, while being completely random on the dimensions you're missing.</p>

        <p>A seed list where 60% of accounts are missing revenue data will produce lookalikes that match on everything except revenue. If revenue concentration actually matters for your sales motion (enterprise vs. mid-market, for example), you'll get lookalikes spanning a range you can't actually serve.</p>

        <h3>Inconsistent data quality</h3>

        <p>Inconsistency is worse than absence. If some records have detailed industry sub-classifications while others have broad categories, the model sees noise. "Software" and "Enterprise SaaS - Security" might both be accurate, but they describe different levels of granularity. The algorithm can't reconcile them.</p>

        <p>Same problem with technology data. One record might list "Salesforce" while another lists "Salesforce Sales Cloud Enterprise Edition." Technically the same thing, but the model sees them as different data points. Without normalization, your patterns fragment.</p>

        <h3>Outdated information</h3>

        <p>B2B data decays at roughly 30% annually. The company that was 50 employees when you closed them might be 200 now. They got acquired, changed industries, adopted new technology. Your seed list reflects who they were, not who they are.</p>

        <p>If you're modeling on stale data, you're finding companies that match your customers' past states. Those companies may have already evolved past the stage where your product fits. Or the attributes that made them ideal have changed in ways your data doesn't reflect.</p>

        <h3>Surface-level matching</h3>

        <p>Most lookalike tools match on whatever data is available. That usually means industry, company size, and geography because those fields have the highest fill rates. But surface-level attributes often have the weakest predictive power.</p>

        <p>The attributes that actually predict success tend to be harder to capture: technology adoption patterns, organizational structure, growth trajectory, funding dynamics, operational maturity. Without enrichment, these dimensions don't exist in your seed data. Without them, your lookalikes are similar in ways that don't matter.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our lookalikes were matching on industry and size. Once we enriched for tech stack and growth signals, we found a completely different set of accounts. Conversion improved 4x."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">-- VP Demand Gen, Series C SaaS</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What Makes a Good Lookalike Model</h2>

        <p>Effective B2B lookalike modeling requires complete, consistent, and predictive data. Not just more data points, but the right data points organized in ways that reveal patterns.</p>

        <h3>Complete firmographic profiles</h3>

        <p>Every seed account needs the same core dimensions filled: employee count (current and growth rate), revenue range, industry classification (standardized taxonomy), geography, founding date, and ownership structure. When these are complete and consistent across all seed accounts, the model can identify which firmographic dimensions actually correlate with success.</p>

        <p>Fill rates matter. If 95% of your seed accounts have accurate employee count, the model can reliably use that dimension. If only 40% have revenue data, that dimension becomes noise. Completeness enables pattern detection.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack intelligence</h3>

        <p>What tools your customers use often predicts more than what industry they're in. A company running Salesforce Enterprise, Marketo, and Snowflake signals something about their operational maturity, budget, and buying patterns. Those signals transfer to lookalike identification.</p>

        <p>Technographic data reveals which technologies coexist with your product, which indicate complementary buying cycles, and which suggest competitive displacement opportunities. For many B2B companies, tech stack is the highest-signal dimension for lookalike modeling.</p>

        <h3>Growth and funding signals</h3>

        <p>Static attributes describe who a company is. Dynamic signals describe where they're going. Recent funding, hiring velocity, news mentions, and expansion patterns indicate trajectory. A company that matches your best customers on firmographics but is contracting might not be a true lookalike.</p>

        <p>Growth signals also help with timing. Lookalikes at the right stage in their evolution are more likely to buy than perfect matches at the wrong stage.</p>

        <h3>Behavioral and intent indicators</h3>

        <p>What companies are actively doing matters as much as what they are. Job postings reveal priorities. Technology changes indicate transition moments. Content consumption patterns suggest active buying cycles. These behavioral layers add context that static attributes can't capture.</p>

        <p>The best lookalike models combine structural similarity (firmographics, technographics) with behavioral similarity (intent, activity, trajectory). That combination identifies accounts that look like your customers and are likely to be in-market.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Enables Lookalike Modeling</h2>

        <p>We don't build lookalike models. We prepare the data that makes lookalike models work. The enrichment, standardization, and quality that transforms a sparse seed list into a modeling-ready dataset.</p>

        <h3>Seed list enrichment</h3>

        <p>Start with your customer list in whatever state it's in. We enrich every record with 50+ data points from verified sources. Employee count, revenue, industry, technology stack, funding history, growth signals, organizational structure. What was sparse becomes complete.</p>

        <p>The enrichment is designed for modeling. Consistent taxonomies, normalized values, standardized formats. Every record structured the same way so patterns emerge clearly.</p>

        <h3>Attribute analysis and prioritization</h3>

        <p>Not all attributes predict equally. Once we've enriched your seed list, we can help identify which dimensions correlate most strongly with customer success. Is it tech stack? Growth rate? Funding stage? Geographic cluster?</p>

        <p>This analysis informs how you weight dimensions in your lookalike model. Rather than treating all attributes equally, you emphasize the ones that actually matter for your specific business.</p>

        <h3>Universe enrichment</h3>

        <p>A complete seed list isn't enough if your target universe is incomplete. We can enrich your full target account list or market database with the same attributes as your seeds. Same data quality, same dimensions, same formats. Apples to apples comparison.</p>

        <p>Many clients come to us with enriched seeds but sparse universe data. The model can't find matches that don't exist in the dataset. Parallel enrichment solves this.</p>

        <h3>Ongoing refresh</h3>

        <p>Lookalike models decay along with the data they're built on. Companies change. Your customer base evolves. What worked last quarter might not work next quarter. We offer ongoing enrichment to keep seed lists and target universes current, so your models stay accurate.</p>

        <h2>Connection to ICP Development</h2>

        <p>Lookalike modeling and ICP development are two sides of the same coin. Your ICP defines who you're looking for. Lookalike modeling finds more of them. Both require the same foundation: complete, accurate data about your existing customers.</p>

        <p>If you haven't validated your ICP with data, your lookalike model inherits those assumptions. You might be building lookalikes of customers you think are best, rather than customers who actually perform best. The enrichment work for lookalike modeling often reveals ICP insights as a byproduct.</p>

        <p>Many clients start with lookalike enrichment, discover patterns in the data, then engage for <a href="/use-cases/icp-development/">formal ICP development</a>. Or they refine their ICP first, then build lookalikes on the validated definition. Either path leads to better targeting.</p>

        <p>What matters is having the data to test assumptions. Whether your goal is lookalikes, ICP refinement, or both, enrichment is the starting point.</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Seed list export.</strong> Pull your customer list with whatever data you have. Include any outcome indicators (contract value, retention, NRR, support tickets) that define "best." More context helps us understand what you're optimizing for.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Scoping call (30 minutes).</strong> What does your current data look like? What attributes do you think matter? What are you planning to do with the lookalike output? This conversation shapes the enrichment approach.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data cleaning.</strong> Before enrichment, we standardize company names, deduplicate records, and fix formatting issues. Clean foundations produce better matches.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Enrichment.</strong> We add firmographic, technographic, funding, and behavioral data from 50+ verified sources. Every record gets the same treatment, same dimensions, same quality.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery and analysis.</strong> You receive the enriched dataset in your preferred format. We walk through the results, highlight interesting patterns, and discuss implications for your lookalike model.</p>

        <p>Typical timeline: 3-5 business days from data handoff to delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Seed list enrichment starts at $0.02-0.05 per record, depending on the depth of enrichment required. A typical project with 500-1,000 seed accounts runs $500-2,500.</p>

        <p>If you also need universe enrichment (enriching your target account list to match against), we provide volume pricing. The per-record cost decreases significantly at scale.</p>

        <p>We provide a fixed quote after reviewing your data. No hourly billing, no scope creep. You know the cost before we start.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How many seed accounts do I need for effective lookalike modeling?</h3>
          <p>Quality matters more than quantity. With 30-50 well-enriched seed accounts, you can identify meaningful patterns. With 100+ seed accounts, statistical confidence increases significantly. But 500 incomplete records will produce worse results than 50 complete ones. The key is having enough data points per account to model on, not just having more accounts.</p>

          <h3>What data points are most important for B2B lookalike modeling?</h3>
          <p>The most predictive attributes vary by business, but typically include: employee count and growth rate, industry and sub-industry classification, technology stack (especially your category and adjacent tools), funding stage and recent investment, geographic footprint, and organizational structure. Technographic data often outperforms firmographics alone because it reveals operational maturity and buying patterns.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from LinkedIn or Facebook lookalike audiences?</h3>
          <p>Platform lookalikes optimize for engagement within their ecosystem, not purchase behavior. They match on surface-level similarities and behavioral patterns within the platform. B2B lookalike modeling with enriched data matches on the actual attributes that predict customer success: technology stack, company structure, growth trajectory, and business model. You own the methodology and can apply it across any channel.</p>

          <h3>Can you help if we don't know what makes our best customers "best"?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We often work with companies who have customer data but haven't analyzed what drives success. We can enrich your full customer base, then help identify patterns that correlate with retention, expansion, or profitability. The enrichment reveals segments you may not have known existed. Many clients discover their "best" customers share attributes they never considered.</p>
