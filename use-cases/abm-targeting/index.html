        <h2>The ABM Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>ABM promises personalized campaigns to high-value accounts. The reality is usually different. You build a target account list based on whatever data exists in your CRM. Industry fields are blank for half the accounts. Employee counts are outdated. You can't tell partners from end customers from distributors.</p>

        <p>So you target broadly, hoping the right accounts see your campaigns. Money spent on impressions to accounts that were never going to buy. Meanwhile, your best-fit accounts get lost in generic messaging because you didn't have the data to identify them.</p>

        <p>A data protection company we worked with had exactly this problem. Fifty thousand accounts in their database, but no way to segment them effectively. Industry classifications were missing for thousands. They couldn't tell which accounts were MSPs versus end customers versus distributors.</p>

        <p>For a company that sells through MSP partners, this wasn't just an inconvenience. It was a strategic blind spot.</p>

        <h3>What we discovered</h3>

        <p>When we enriched their account data, we found 703 MSP accounts buried in generic "Partner" categories. Seven hundred accounts that should have been receiving targeted MSP campaigns, MSP-specific content, MSP pricing discussions. Instead, they were getting the same generic messaging as everyone else.</p>

        <p>We also mapped 305 subsidiaries to 122 parent companies. Their ABM campaigns had been treating different divisions of the same organization as unrelated accounts. One division getting acquisition campaigns while another was already a customer.</p>

        <h3>The results</h3>

        <p>98.6% industry classification coverage after enrichment. They finally knew who was in their database. MSPs could get MSP campaigns. Enterprise accounts could get enterprise treatment. Partners could be recognized and managed appropriately.</p>

        <p>Those 703 MSPs? If the average MSP deal is $25K annually and they convert just 5%, that's 35 new deals. $875,000 in new annual recurring revenue from accounts that were already in their CRM.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide for ABM Targeting</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Standardized codes that match your segmentation model. Know which accounts are MSPs, which are enterprise, which are mid-market. Target appropriately.</li>

          <li><strong>Employee count.</strong> Current headcount validated against multiple sources. Tier accounts accurately for ABM prioritization.</li>

          <li><strong>Revenue range.</strong> Annual revenue bands for identifying high-value targets. We use multiple signals when public data isn't available.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use today. Target accounts using competitors you can replace or platforms you integrate with.</li>

          <li><strong>Parent/subsidiary mapping.</strong> Know which accounts roll up to the same organization. Coordinate campaigns across related entities instead of competing with yourself.</li>

          <li><strong>Funding and growth signals.</strong> Recent funding rounds, headcount growth, expansion news. Prioritize accounts that are actively investing.</li>

          <li><strong>Contact coverage.</strong> Key decision-makers at each account. Names, titles, emails, direct dials. Your ABM campaigns need people to target, not just companies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your target account list.</strong> Export from your CRM, marketing automation platform, or send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and identify gaps.</strong> Before we enrich anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Industry coverage. Firmographic gaps. Contact availability.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, LinkedIn, SEC filings, job postings, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Industry classifications that need judgment. Parent companies that share names with unrelated businesses.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: You get enriched data back.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to power your ABM campaigns. Complete firmographic profiles for every account.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>ABM account enrichment runs $0.10-0.50 per account, depending on which fields you need. Full firmographic plus contact enrichment is at the higher end. Company data only is lower.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
