        <h2>The CDP Data Problem: Garbage In, Garbage Out</h2>

        <p>You've invested six figures in a Customer Data Platform. Segment, mParticle, Salesforce CDP, Treasure Data, Tealium. The promise was compelling: unified customer profiles, real-time personalization, better marketing attribution. A single source of truth for customer data.</p>

        <p>Six months later, you're staring at the same fragmented customer view you started with. The CDP works fine. The problem is what you fed it.</p>

        <p>Your CRM has three records for the same customer: one from 2019 when they used their work email, one from 2021 when they switched jobs, and one from last month when they filled out a form with a typo in their name. Your e-commerce system has purchase history under a fourth email address. Your support platform has tickets under a fifth.</p>

        <p>The CDP dutifully unified all five records into one customer profile. Now you have a profile with five email addresses, three job titles, two companies, and a purchase history that mixes up two different people who happened to have similar names.</p>

        <p>This isn't a CDP problem. It's a source data problem. And according to Gartner, it's why 70% of CDP implementations fail to deliver expected value.</p>

        <h3>Why CDPs Don't Fix Data Quality</h3>

        <p>CDPs are designed to unify and activate data, not to clean it. They pull data from your source systems, match records using identity resolution, and create unified customer profiles. The matching algorithms are sophisticated. They can link "john.smith@company.com" to "jsmith@company.com" based on behavioral patterns and device graphs.</p>

        <p>But they can't tell the difference between "John Smith" who works at Acme Corp and "John Smith" who works at Beta Inc when both records have incomplete data. They can't know that the "Marketing Manager" title in Salesforce is three years old and that person is now a VP at a different company. They can't fix the phone number that's missing country codes or the address that's formatted wrong.</p>

        <p>Forrester research shows that the average B2B database contains 25% duplicate records before any cleaning. For companies with multiple customer-facing systems, that number often exceeds 40%. Every duplicate that makes it into your CDP creates a fragmented profile that undermines every downstream use case.</p>

        <h3>The Hidden Cost of CDP Data Problems</h3>

        <p>Bad data in your CDP isn't just an inconvenience. It directly impacts revenue:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Inflated platform costs.</strong> Most CDPs charge per profile. Duplicates mean you're paying for the same customer multiple times. We've seen companies reduce their CDP costs by 30% just by deduplicating before migration.</li>
          <li><strong>Broken personalization.</strong> That sophisticated email sequence you built falls apart when your CDP thinks one customer is three people. They get the same "welcome" email three times or miss the re-engagement campaign entirely.</li>
          <li><strong>Inaccurate attribution.</strong> When purchases are split across duplicate profiles, your attribution models show misleading results. Campaigns that drove revenue look ineffective because the purchase happened on a different profile.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance risk.</strong> GDPR deletion requests are hard enough when you have one record per customer. With duplicates scattered across your CDP, you might delete two records and miss the third. That's a compliance violation waiting to happen.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The CDP Institute estimates that poor data quality costs organizations an average of $12.9 million per year. Much of that cost is hidden in missed opportunities, wasted marketing spend, and inefficient operations.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Prepares Data for CDP Success</h2>

        <p>We don't sell CDP software. We make sure your CDP software actually works by cleaning the data that feeds it. Before you migrate a single record, we identify and fix the quality issues that derail CDP implementations.</p>

        <h3>Deduplication Across Source Systems</h3>

        <p>Your CRM, email platform, e-commerce system, and support tools all have their own customer records. Same customer, different data, different formats. We find and merge these duplicates at the source, so your CDP receives clean, deduplicated data from every system.</p>

        <p><strong>For CDP teams:</strong> Fewer duplicates means fewer unified profiles, which means lower CDP costs and more accurate identity resolution. One client reduced their Segment profile count by 34% after we cleaned their source data.</p>

        <h3>Identity Standardization</h3>

        <p>Email addresses with typos. Phone numbers missing country codes. Addresses in inconsistent formats. Names with varying capitalization. These variations make identity matching harder for your CDP. We standardize every identity field to maximize match rates and minimize false duplicates.</p>

        <p><strong>For CDP teams:</strong> Standardized data means your CDP's identity resolution algorithms work as intended. No more "partial matches" that create separate profiles for the same person.</p>

        <h3>Data Enrichment for Complete Profiles</h3>

        <p>Empty fields can't be unified. If your CRM has email but no phone, and your e-commerce system has phone but no email, you're relying entirely on the CDP's matching logic. We enrich records with missing contact information, firmographic data, and other attributes so matching works reliably.</p>

        <p><strong>For CDP teams:</strong> Complete records match more accurately. Enriched data also means richer unified profiles that enable better segmentation and personalization.</p>

        <h3>Source System Cleanup</h3>

        <p>CDPs typically maintain a real-time sync with source systems. If you don't fix the data in Salesforce, HubSpot, or your e-commerce platform, the same bad data keeps flowing into your CDP. We clean data at the source so your CDP stays clean.</p>

        <p><strong>For CDP teams:</strong> One-time cleanup plus ongoing hygiene keeps your CDP accurate long-term. No point cleaning for migration if dirty data starts flowing in again the next day.</p>

        <h2>Integration with Major CDP Platforms</h2>

        <p>We've prepared data for implementations across every major CDP platform. The cleaning and enrichment work is the same; the integration patterns differ.</p>

        <h3>Segment</h3>
        <p>Segment's identity resolution works best with standardized email and device IDs. We clean and standardize your source data, then you can push it through your existing Segment sources. For historical data migration, we prepare CSV exports that match Segment's expected schema.</p>

        <h3>mParticle</h3>
        <p>mParticle's IDSync requires consistent identity values across sources. We normalize identity fields (email formats, phone number formatting, customer ID patterns) before migration. For audience sync, we ensure the customer attributes your marketing tools need are complete and accurate.</p>

        <h3>Salesforce CDP (Data Cloud)</h3>
        <p>Salesforce CDP pulls from Salesforce CRM and external sources. We clean your Salesforce data directly, ensuring it meets Data Cloud's data model requirements. For external sources, we prepare data in compatible formats with proper identity field mapping.</p>

        <h3>Other Platforms</h3>
        <p>Treasure Data, Tealium, ActionIQ, Amperity, Bloomreach, and others all benefit from clean source data. The specific integration approach varies, but the data quality work is consistent: deduplicate, standardize, enrich, validate.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How CDP Data Preparation Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Data source inventory.</strong> We map every system that will feed your CDP: CRM, marketing automation, e-commerce, support, product analytics, and any other customer data sources. Each source has its own quality issues to address.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Quality assessment.</strong> Before cleaning anything, you'll see exactly what's wrong. Duplicate rates by source, field completeness, format inconsistencies, invalid values. This report helps prioritize which sources need the most work.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Deduplication.</strong> We identify duplicates within and across source systems using fuzzy matching on names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and company information. You review merge recommendations before we execute.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Standardization.</strong> Every identity field gets normalized: email format, phone number format with country codes, address standardization to postal standards, name capitalization. This maximizes CDP matching accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Enrichment.</strong> Missing fields get filled from our 50+ data sources. Email verification, phone validation, firmographic data, contact information. Complete records match better and enable richer profiles.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 6: Validation and import.</strong> Final data quality checks, format validation for your CDP platform, and clean data delivered in your preferred format. We can provide direct import to source systems or export files for migration.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing maintenance (optional).</strong> Data decays at 2-3% per month. After initial cleanup, we can run monthly hygiene to keep your CDP data accurate. New records get cleaned and enriched as they enter your source systems.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>CDP data preparation pricing depends on the number of source systems and total record volume. Most projects fall into these ranges:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Single source cleanup:</strong> $0.10-0.30 per record for deduplication, standardization, and basic enrichment. A 100,000 record CRM cleanup typically runs $15,000-25,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-source preparation:</strong> $0.15-0.40 per record when cleaning multiple systems and cross-system deduplication. Pricing scales down as volume increases.</li>
          <li><strong>Full CDP migration prep:</strong> Custom projects for large migrations typically include fixed pricing for the complete scope. Most enterprise projects range $25,000-75,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing hygiene:</strong> Monthly maintenance runs $0.02-0.05 per record to keep data clean after initial preparation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About CDP Data Quality</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why do most CDP implementations fail?</h3>
          <p>According to Gartner, 70% of CDP projects fail to meet expectations, and poor source data quality is the primary reason. CDPs are designed to unify and activate data, not to fix it. They'll faithfully replicate every duplicate, outdated record, and data quality issue from your source systems into unified profiles. The technology works; the data doesn't.</p>

          <h3>Should I clean data before or after CDP implementation?</h3>
          <p>Before. Always before. Cleaning data inside a CDP is expensive and complex. Most platforms charge based on profile count, so duplicates directly inflate your costs from day one. Clean and deduplicate your source data before migration to reduce CDP costs, ensure accurate unified profiles, and avoid the pain of retroactive cleanup.</p>

          <h3>What data sources should be cleaned before CDP integration?</h3>
          <p>All of them. Every system that feeds your CDP carries its own data quality baggage. CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot) typically have the highest duplicate rates. Email marketing platforms have deliverability issues. E-commerce databases have address and identity fragmentation. Support systems have inconsistent customer identification. Each source brings problems that compound when unified.</p>

          <h3>How long does CDP data preparation take?</h3>
          <p>Typically 2-4 weeks for a full data preparation project, depending on the number of source systems and total record volume. We can run parallel workstreams to clean multiple sources simultaneously. Most clients see the first cleaned dataset within 48 hours of project kickoff, with the full project completing before their CDP implementation timeline requires it.</p>
