<h2>Smb Targeting</h2>
<p>Targeting small and medium businesses requires different data sources and methods than enterprise prospecting. SMB companies are less likely to appear in traditional B2B databases, their contacts change roles more frequently, and their firmographic data is harder to verify. We specialize in finding and verifying SMB data.</p>

<p>Your database providers have great coverage of Fortune 500 companies. But when you search for plumbing companies with 10-50 employees or independent insurance agencies, the results are thin, outdated, or wrong. SMB data is a known gap in most B2B data platforms because small businesses are harder to track.</p>

<h2>How We Find SMB Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-source discovery.</strong> We pull SMB data from sources that enterprise-focused databases miss: state business registrations, local licensing databases, Google Business profiles, and industry-specific directories.</li>
    <li><strong>Owner identification.</strong> At SMBs, the owner is usually the decision-maker. We identify business owners by name with direct contact information, not just the business phone number.</li>
    <li><strong>Verification at scale.</strong> We verify email addresses and phone numbers for SMB contacts who are notoriously harder to reach than enterprise contacts with standardized corporate email formats.</li>
    <li><strong>Firmographic estimation.</strong> SMBs don't report to public databases. We estimate employee count, revenue range, and years in business from available signals to enable size-based targeting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SMB Targeting Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Access to SMB contacts that major databases don't cover because we use local and industry-specific sources</li>
    <li>Owner-level contact data because at small businesses, the owner is the buyer</li>
    <li>Estimated firmographics for targeting and segmentation even when SMBs don't self-report their size</li>
    <li>Territory-ready lists organized by geography for local and regional sales teams</li>
</ul>
