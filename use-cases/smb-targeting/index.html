        <h2>The SMB Targeting Problem Nobody Talks About</h2>

        <p>There are 33.2 million small businesses in the United States, according to the <a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/2023/03/07/frequently-asked-questions-about-small-business-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Small Business Administration</a>. They employ nearly half the American workforce. They represent trillions in annual spending.</p>

        <p>And most B2B companies have no idea how to reach them effectively.</p>

        <p>The irony is brutal. SMBs are underserved by enterprise vendors, more willing to try new solutions, and often make purchasing decisions in days rather than quarters. They should be the perfect target market. But every company that's tried to build an SMB go-to-market motion has run into the same wall: the data just isn't there.</p>

        <h3>Limited Data Availability</h3>

        <p>Enterprise companies leave data trails everywhere. Funding announcements. Press releases. LinkedIn company pages with hundreds of employees to track. Technographic signals from the dozens of tools they use. SEC filings. Conference speaker lists.</p>

        <p>Small businesses leave almost nothing. A local plumber doesn't issue press releases. A three-person accounting firm doesn't have a VP of Operations you can find on LinkedIn. A family-owned restaurant doesn't appear in Crunchbase.</p>

        <p>Traditional data providers built their databases around enterprise signals. That's where the data is, so that's what they sell. Try pulling a list of HVAC companies with 5-20 employees in the Dallas metro from your standard B2B database. You'll get maybe 40% coverage. The rest simply don't exist in the system.</p>

        <h3>Extreme Data Decay</h3>

        <p>Small business data decays at roughly twice the rate of enterprise data. The SBA reports that approximately 20% of small businesses fail within their first year, and about 50% fail within five years. That's not counting the businesses that simply change: new phone numbers, relocated offices, renamed entities, ownership transitions.</p>

        <p>When you're working with enterprise accounts, you might verify your data annually. With SMB data, anything older than 6 months is suspect. Anything older than a year is probably worthless.</p>

        <h3>Owner-Operator Complexity</h3>

        <p>Enterprise sales is complicated because you have to navigate buying committees. SMB sales is complicated because there is no buying committee. The owner is the decision-maker, the implementer, and often the end user. Finding the right person is easy in theory, impossibly hard in practice.</p>

        <p>Owners don't always list themselves as "Owner" on LinkedIn. They might be "Managing Director" or "Principal" or have no title at all. They use personal cell phones as business lines. Personal Gmail accounts for business correspondence. Their only web presence might be a Facebook page they haven't updated in two years.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-xl">
          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See How We Solve SMB Data Challenges</a>
        </div>

        <h2>Why SMB Data Is So Challenging to Source</h2>

        <p>Understanding why the problem exists helps you evaluate potential solutions. SMB data isn't just scarce. It's fundamentally different from enterprise data in ways that break traditional data collection methods.</p>

        <h3>Minimal Online Footprint</h3>

        <p>Enterprise companies have robust websites, active social media, news coverage, and employee activity across professional networks. SMBs often have a single-page website (or no website at all), a Google Business Profile they set up and forgot about, and zero LinkedIn presence.</p>

        <p>Data providers that rely on web scraping and social listening simply can't find these businesses. You can't scrape what doesn't exist.</p>

        <h3>Non-Standard Business Structures</h3>

        <p>A small business might operate as a sole proprietorship, an LLC, an S-corp, or a partnership. It might have a DBA that's completely different from the legal entity name. The owner might run three separate businesses through the same LLC. Or run one business through three different entities.</p>

        <p>This makes deduplication nearly impossible without human judgment. Is "Johnson's HVAC" the same as "Johnson Heating and Cooling LLC"? Maybe. Depends on the address, the phone number, whether Mike Johnson or his brother Dave is listed as the owner.</p>

        <h3>Diverse Industry Classification</h3>

        <p>Enterprise companies fit neatly into industry categories. Apple is technology. Goldman Sachs is financial services. Easy.</p>

        <p>SMBs blur the lines constantly. A landscaping company that also does snow removal and has started offering pressure washing. A bookkeeper who also provides payroll services and business consulting. A restaurant that caters events and runs a food truck on weekends.</p>

        <p>Standard NAICS codes capture maybe 60% of what these businesses actually do. The rest requires human interpretation and often direct research.</p>

        <h3>Contact Information Chaos</h3>

        <p>Enterprise contacts have predictable patterns. firstname.lastname@company.com. Direct dial extensions. LinkedIn profiles with clear job titles and tenure.</p>

        <p>SMB contacts are chaos. Personal Gmail addresses used for business. Cell phones that might be the owner's personal number or a Google Voice line they check occasionally. "Contact us" forms that go to a Yahoo account the owner's teenage daughter set up in 2015.</p>

        <p>Reaching the right person requires verification that goes far beyond checking if an email address is valid.</p>

        <h2>Understanding SMB Segments: Different Data for Different Targets</h2>

        <p>The term "SMB" covers an enormous range of business sizes and sophistication levels. A solo consultant working from her kitchen table has almost nothing in common with a 200-person manufacturing company with multiple facilities. Your data strategy needs to account for these differences.</p>

        <h3>Micro Businesses (1-9 Employees)</h3>

        <p>This is where data challenges are most acute. Micro businesses represent the vast majority of the 33 million US small businesses. Many are side hustles or lifestyle businesses. Most have no formal business infrastructure whatsoever.</p>

        <p><strong>Data priorities:</strong> Owner direct contact is the only thing that matters. There's no marketing department to nurture. No procurement team to navigate. You need the owner's phone number and email, and you need to know if the business is actually operating.</p>

        <p><strong>Verification challenges:</strong> Many micro businesses operate informally. No business license. No dedicated phone line. No website. Verification often requires calling the number to confirm someone answers.</p>

        <h3>Small Businesses (10-49 Employees)</h3>

        <p>At this size, businesses start to develop some structure. There might be a dedicated office manager or bookkeeper. Maybe an operations person who handles vendor relationships. But ultimate decisions still flow through the owner.</p>

        <p><strong>Data priorities:</strong> Owner contact remains critical, but you may also want to identify functional contacts for specific use cases. A payroll software vendor might target the person who actually runs payroll, even if the owner signs the check.</p>

        <p><strong>Verification challenges:</strong> These businesses usually have websites and phone lines, making basic verification easier. But organizational structure data is often unavailable. You might know the company has 25 employees. Good luck finding out who handles what.</p>

        <h3>Medium Businesses (50-249 Employees)</h3>

        <p>Medium businesses start to look more like enterprises. Dedicated departments. Professional management. Formal purchasing processes. But they still lack the data coverage that enterprise accounts receive.</p>

        <p><strong>Data priorities:</strong> At this level, you need to identify specific decision-makers by function, similar to enterprise targeting. But you also need firmographic data that enterprise databases often miss: accurate employee counts, revenue estimates, technology stack.</p>

        <p><strong>Verification challenges:</strong> The data exists, but it's scattered and often inaccurate. A medium business might appear in traditional databases, but with employee counts that are two years out of date and technology data that's completely wrong.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Solves SMB Data Challenges</h2>

        <p>We've worked with dozens of companies building SMB go-to-market motions. From lenders targeting small business owners to SaaS companies selling to local service businesses, we've developed approaches specifically for SMB data challenges.</p>

        <h3>Owner and Decision-Maker Identification</h3>

        <p>For SMBs, finding the right person is 90% of the battle. We specialize in identifying owner-operators and key decision-makers, including direct contact information that actually reaches them.</p>

        <p>This means personal email addresses when that's what they use for business. Cell phone numbers verified as active. LinkedIn profiles even when they're sparse. We don't just tell you a business exists. We tell you how to reach the person who makes decisions.</p>

        <h3>Firmographic Enrichment Built for SMBs</h3>

        <p>Standard firmographic data assumes enterprise patterns. Revenue figures based on public filings. Employee counts from LinkedIn. Technology stacks from website scanning.</p>

        <p>We build SMB firmographics differently. Employee count estimates from multiple sources including licensing databases, payroll signals, and direct research. Revenue estimates calibrated to SMB patterns. Industry classification based on what the business actually does, not just what NAICS code they registered under.</p>

        <h3>Business Verification at Scale</h3>

        <p>An enterprise company doesn't disappear overnight. An SMB might. Our verification processes are built for the reality of small business volatility. We check business status against multiple signals: active websites, answered phone lines, current business licenses, recent reviews, social activity.</p>

        <p>We also provide confidence scores so you can prioritize outreach. A business with a recently updated Google profile, active Yelp reviews, and a working phone number is a better use of your sales team's time than one with a website that hasn't been updated since 2019.</p>

        <h3>Local Market Intelligence</h3>

        <p>Many SMB-focused companies need to target specific geographies. We provide enrichment that supports hyper-local targeting: county-level data, metro area segmentation, neighborhood classifications, and even proximity analysis for field sales and service businesses.</p>

        <h2>The Process: From Messy SMB Data to Actionable Lists</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Assessment (Free)</strong><br>
        Send us a sample of your current SMB data or describe your target market. We'll analyze what you have, identify gaps, and estimate what it takes to get you to a usable dataset. This takes about 5 minutes of your time.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Scope Definition</strong><br>
        We work with you to define exactly what you need. Target geography? Industry verticals? Company size ranges? Data fields required? Verification standards? This ensures we deliver data you can actually use, not generic SMB records.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Compilation</strong><br>
        Our team sources, verifies, and enriches SMB records against your specifications. This might include owner identification, firmographic enrichment, contact verification, or all of the above. We use a combination of database access, direct research, and verification calls.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Quality Review</strong><br>
        Every record goes through human QA. Not algorithmic confidence scores presented as verification. Actual humans reviewing actual records to ensure they meet your criteria.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery</strong><br>
        You receive clean, enriched data in whatever format works for your systems. CSV for simple uploads. API integration for technical teams. Direct CRM sync for ongoing programs. The data is yours. No licensing restrictions. No recurring fees unless you want ongoing updates.</p>

        <h2>SMB Data Enrichment Pricing</h2>

        <p>We price based on scope and volume, not arbitrary seat licenses or platform fees. A few benchmarks:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>List enrichment:</strong> Starting at $0.50 per record for basic firmographic append on existing SMB lists</li>
          <li><strong>Owner identification:</strong> $1-3 per record depending on depth of verification and contact detail requirements</li>
          <li><strong>List building:</strong> $2-5 per record for net-new SMB targeting lists with verified contact information</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing refresh:</strong> Monthly or quarterly updates priced at 30-50% of initial enrichment, depending on volume</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Every project starts with a free assessment. We'll look at what you have, tell you what it would cost to get where you want to be, and you decide if it makes sense.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About SMB Data Targeting</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why is SMB data harder to find than enterprise data?</h3>
          <p>Small businesses have minimal online presence, rarely appear in press releases or funding announcements, and often use personal email addresses rather than company domains. Owner-operators frequently use their cell phones as the business line, and many SMBs operate across multiple industries without clear classification. Traditional data providers focus on enterprise accounts where the data is easier to compile.</p>

          <h3>What firmographic data can you provide for small businesses?</h3>
          <p>We provide employee count ranges, estimated revenue, years in business, industry classification (NAICS/SIC), location data including multi-location identification, ownership structure, and business entity type. For owner-operated businesses, we also provide direct contact information for decision-makers rather than generic company emails.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle the high turnover rate of small businesses?</h3>
          <p>We verify business status at the time of enrichment using multiple signals including website activity, phone verification, licensing databases, and social presence. We also provide confidence scores so you can prioritize outreach to businesses with stronger verification signals. For ongoing campaigns, we offer refresh services to keep your SMB data current.</p>

          <h3>What's the difference between micro, small, and medium business data needs?</h3>
          <p>Micro businesses (1-9 employees) require owner direct contact and often have no formal business infrastructure. Small businesses (10-49 employees) may have functional departments but decisions still flow through the owner. Medium businesses (50-249 employees) look more like enterprises with dedicated roles, but still lack the data coverage of larger companies. Each segment requires different data strategies and verification approaches.</p>
