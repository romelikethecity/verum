<h2>Customer Segmentation</h2>
<p>Customer segmentation divides your customer base into meaningful groups based on shared characteristics. But segmentation based on incomplete or inaccurate data creates segments that don't reflect reality. We clean and enrich customer data so your segments are built on solid ground.</p>

<p>You're trying to segment by company size, but 35% of your accounts are missing employee count data. You want to segment by industry, but your industry field has 200 free-text variations of the same 15 industries. Your segments are unreliable because the data they're built on is unreliable.</p>

<h2>How We Improve Segmentation Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Field completion.</strong> We fill in the firmographic fields your segmentation depends on: company size, revenue, industry, location, and whatever custom fields your model uses.</li>
    <li><strong>Value standardization.</strong> Free-text fields get mapped to standardized values. Your 200 industry variations become 15 clean categories that segment cleanly.</li>
    <li><strong>Data verification.</strong> We confirm that the data driving your segments is current. A company that was a startup two years ago might be mid-market now.</li>
    <li><strong>Enrichment with new dimensions.</strong> We add fields you don't have yet — tech stack, funding stage, growth rate — that can power more sophisticated segmentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Segmentation Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Segments that accurately represent distinct groups because the underlying data is complete and standardized</li>
    <li>New segmentation dimensions you couldn't use before because the data didn't exist in your CRM</li>
    <li>Consistent segment membership over time because field values are standardized and regularly refreshed</li>
    <li>Marketing campaigns that perform better because each segment is truly homogeneous</li>
</ul>
