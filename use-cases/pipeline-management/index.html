        <h2>Why Pipeline Data Matters</h2>

        <p>Pipeline review meetings shouldn't be archaeology expeditions. But that's what happens when data quality degrades. Reps dig through contacts to figure out who's still at the company. Managers ask why the same account appears twice. Leadership wonders why forecasts are always off.</p>

        <p><strong>Duplicate accounts inflate everything.</strong> The same company shows up as three opportunities because it's in the CRM three ways. Pipeline looks bigger than it is. Coverage ratios are wrong. Forecasts are optimistic until they're not.</p>

        <p><strong>Stale contacts hide dead deals.</strong> Your champion left four months ago. Nobody updated the record. The opportunity sits in pipeline, forecasted to close, attached to someone who doesn't work there. Research shows 30% of contacts change jobs every year. Your pipeline is full of ghosts.</p>

        <p><strong>Missing data prevents prioritization.</strong> You don't know which deals are enterprise vs. mid-market because company size isn't filled in. Can't prioritize by vertical because industry is blank. Reps guess instead of knowing where to focus.</p>

        <p><strong>Bad data compounds.</strong> One wrong field leads to another. Automations fire incorrectly. Routing rules break. Marketing scores based on incomplete info. By the time a deal reaches late stage, nobody trusts any of the data attached to it.</p>

        <p>Clean pipeline data means accurate forecasts, better prioritization, and less time wasted on deals that aren't real.</p>

        <h2>How We Clean Pipeline Data</h2>

        <p>We take your opportunity data and return a pipeline you can trust. Accurate contacts, complete firmographics, no duplicates.</p>

        <p><strong>Contact verification.</strong> Is your contact still at the company? Still in the same role? We verify against current employment data and flag changes. Dead contacts become visible so you can act on them.</p>

        <p><strong>Account deduplication.</strong> "Acme Inc", "Acme, Inc.", "Acme Corporation" become one account with consolidated history. Pipeline math starts working again.</p>

        <p><strong>Firmographic enrichment.</strong> Fill gaps in company size, industry, revenue, location. The data you need for proper segmentation and prioritization.</p>

        <p><strong>Contact enrichment.</strong> Add missing phone numbers, update email addresses, append LinkedIn profiles. Give reps what they need to reach people.</p>

        <p><strong>Hierarchy mapping.</strong> Understand parent-subsidiary relationships. That mid-market deal might be part of an enterprise family. That enterprise might be buying through a subsidiary.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Verified contacts.</strong> Employment status checked, job changes flagged, current contact info updated. Know who's actually still there.</li>

          <li><strong>Deduplicated accounts.</strong> One record per company with consolidated pipeline. Accurate totals, not inflated counts.</li>

          <li><strong>Complete firmographics.</strong> Company size, industry, revenue, location filled in. Segment and prioritize with confidence.</li>

          <li><strong>Enriched contact data.</strong> Direct dials, mobile numbers, LinkedIn profiles. Reach people faster.</li>

          <li><strong>Stale deal flags.</strong> Opportunities with departed contacts identified. Clean out the ghosts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Pipeline export.</strong> Pull opportunities with associated accounts and contacts from your CRM. Any stage, any timeframe you want to clean.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Analysis.</strong> We assess data quality, identify the biggest issues, and scope the cleaning work needed.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Verification and enrichment.</strong> Contact checks, deduplication, firmographic fills. Typically 24-48 hours processing.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Review.</strong> We present findings. You validate the cleaning rules are right.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Delivery.</strong> Updated records ready to sync back to CRM. Or direct CRM push if you prefer.</p>

        <p>Total timeline: 3-5 days for most pipeline datasets. Quarterly maintenance runs faster once baseline is clean.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How does data quality affect forecasting?</h3>
          <p>Directly. Bad data means inflated pipeline (duplicates), false optimism (stale deals), and poor prioritization (missing firmographics). Clean data enables accurate forecasts.</p>

          <h3>What pipeline data do you clean?</h3>
          <p>Account and contact data primarily. We verify contacts, standardize companies, merge duplicates, and fill firmographic gaps. We also flag stale opportunities.</p>

          <h3>Can you identify stale deals?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We check if contacts are still at the company. If your champion left, we flag it. About 30% of contacts change jobs yearly.</p>

          <h3>How often should we clean pipeline?</h3>
          <p>Quarterly minimum. Monthly for high-velocity teams. One-time deep clean plus ongoing maintenance works well.</p>

          <h3>What about historical pipeline?</h3>
          <p>We can clean current pipeline, historical closed-won for analysis, or both. Historical data cleaning helps with win/loss analysis and forecasting model training.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready to Trust Your Pipeline?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>One-time clean?</strong> We'll audit your pipeline, fix the data, and give you accurate numbers.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing maintenance?</strong> Quarterly or monthly refreshes to keep pipeline data healthy. Never let it degrade again.</p>
