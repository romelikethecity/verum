        <h2>The TAM SAM SOM Problem</h2>

        <p>You're preparing for a board meeting or investor pitch. Someone asks about your Total Addressable Market. So you pull numbers from a Gartner report or Grand View Research study that says your market is worth $47 billion by 2027.</p>

        <p>The problem? That number tells you almost nothing useful.</p>

        <p>Industry reports use top-down estimates. They take total industry revenue, apply growth assumptions, and produce a number that sounds impressive but has no connection to your actual business. A company selling cybersecurity compliance software to mid-market healthcare organizations is not competing for the entire $47 billion "healthcare IT market." They're competing for a specific slice of companies that match their product, pricing, and go-to-market capabilities.</p>

        <h3>The Inflation Problem</h3>

        <p>Most TAM calculations are inflated by 5x to 10x or more. Founders and strategy teams grab the largest defensible number because bigger sounds better. But experienced investors see through this immediately. According to research from First Round Capital, unrealistic market sizing is one of the most common reasons VCs pass on otherwise promising deals.<sup>1</sup></p>

        <p>When you claim a $50 billion TAM without showing your methodology, you're signaling one of two things: either you don't understand your market well enough to size it accurately, or you're deliberately inflating numbers to make your opportunity look bigger. Neither inspires confidence.</p>

        <h3>The Assumption Problem</h3>

        <p>Top-down estimates rely on assumptions that rarely hold. The Gartner report assumes certain growth rates, adoption curves, and market dynamics. Your business operates under different constraints. You have a specific ideal customer profile, geographic focus, pricing model, and competitive positioning. None of that shows up in an industry-wide estimate.</p>

        <p>The result is a number that looks good in a slide deck but provides zero strategic value. You can't build a territory plan around "the healthcare IT market is $47 billion." You can't forecast pipeline around a percentage of an imaginary total.</p>

        <h3>What Investors and Boards Actually Want</h3>

        <p>Smart investors and board members don't want to hear that you're going after a trillion-dollar market. They want to see that you understand your market with precision. They want bottom-up analysis that shows you've done the work to identify who actually buys what you sell.</p>

        <p>According to Andreessen Horowitz's market sizing guide, the most credible TAM analyses are built bottom-up from actual customer data and company counts.<sup>2</sup> Instead of saying "the market is $47 billion and we'll capture 1%," you say "there are 12,400 companies that match our ICP, with an average contract value of $45,000, giving us a SAM of $558 million."</p>

        <p>One approach sounds like guessing. The other sounds like you know your business.</p>

        <h2>Understanding TAM, SAM, and SOM</h2>

        <p>Before diving into methodology, let's define these terms clearly. They're often confused or used interchangeably, but they measure fundamentally different things.</p>

        <h3>TAM: Total Addressable Market</h3>

        <p>TAM represents everyone who could theoretically buy your product if you had unlimited resources, no competition, and perfect market conditions. It's the ceiling, not the target. For a B2B software company, TAM might be every company in your target industry regardless of size, geography, or current technology stack.</p>

        <p>TAM answers: "How big is the entire opportunity space?"</p>

        <p>Example: A company selling HR software might have a TAM of all 6.1 million employer businesses in the United States, multiplied by average contract value. That's the theoretical maximum if every single business bought your product.</p>

        <h3>SAM: Serviceable Addressable Market</h3>

        <p>SAM narrows the focus to companies you can realistically serve given your business model, geography, pricing, and capabilities. It's TAM filtered by your actual constraints. If you only sell to mid-market companies (100-1,000 employees) in the United States, your SAM excludes enterprises, SMBs, and international markets.</p>

        <p>SAM answers: "Of the total market, which portion could we actually reach?"</p>

        <p>Example: The same HR software company, targeting only mid-market companies in the US that currently use legacy systems, might have a SAM of 47,000 companies. That's a much more useful number for planning.</p>

        <h3>SOM: Serviceable Obtainable Market</h3>

        <p>SOM represents what you can realistically capture in the near term, typically 1-3 years. It accounts for competition, sales capacity, brand awareness, and market penetration rates. Even if 47,000 companies fit your ICP, you're not going to win all of them. SOM is your realistic target.</p>

        <p>SOM answers: "What can we actually win in the next 1-3 years?"</p>

        <p>Example: With 5 sales reps, reasonable win rates, and established competitors, that HR software company might realistically target a SOM of 2,000 companies, or about 4% of their SAM. That's the number that drives hiring plans and revenue forecasts.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Calculates TAM SAM SOM</h2>

        <p>We use bottom-up methodology with actual company data. Instead of multiplying percentages and assumptions, we count real companies and apply your specific criteria.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Define TAM Criteria</h3>

        <p>We start by identifying every company that could theoretically buy your product. This means defining:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification</strong> using NAICS, SIC, or custom taxonomy</li>
          <li><strong>Geographic scope</strong> down to state, metro, or country level</li>
          <li><strong>Company type</strong> (private, public, nonprofit, government)</li>
          <li><strong>Basic size thresholds</strong> (minimum revenue or employee count)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We then pull every company matching these criteria from our database of 50+ sources, giving you an actual count. Not an estimate. A list of companies.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Filter to SAM</h3>

        <p>Next, we apply your ICP characteristics to narrow the list to companies you can realistically serve:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Employee count ranges</strong> that match your pricing and product fit</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue thresholds</strong> that align with your contract values</li>
          <li><strong>Technology stack requirements</strong> if integration matters</li>
          <li><strong>Specific industry sub-segments</strong> where you have traction</li>
          <li><strong>Exclusion criteria</strong> (companies too small, too large, wrong vertical)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This produces your SAM: the actual number of companies that fit your model. And because it's built from real data, you can see the list. You know exactly who's in your addressable market.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Calculate SOM</h3>

        <p>For SOM, we apply realistic market capture assumptions based on:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Your current market penetration</strong> (existing customers as % of SAM)</li>
          <li><strong>Sales capacity constraints</strong> (reps, territory coverage, deal cycles)</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive intensity</strong> in different segments</li>
          <li><strong>Historical win rates</strong> against different competitor types</li>
          <li><strong>Growth trajectory</strong> and expansion plans</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The output is a defensible near-term target that you can actually use for planning. It's not a fantasy number; it's what you can realistically pursue given your resources.</p>

        <h3>Example: B2B SaaS Company Selling to Healthcare</h3>

        <p>Let's walk through a real methodology. A client sells compliance software to healthcare organizations.</p>

        <p><strong>TAM calculation:</strong> All healthcare organizations in the US (hospitals, clinics, physician groups, nursing facilities) with 50+ employees. Result: 38,400 organizations.</p>

        <p><strong>SAM calculation:</strong> Filter to organizations with 100-2,000 employees (product fit), in states where they have regulatory expertise (compliance focus), using legacy EHR systems (integration opportunity). Result: 8,200 organizations.</p>

        <p><strong>SOM calculation:</strong> With 8 sales reps covering 4 territories, average deal cycle of 6 months, and 22% win rate against identified opportunities, realistic 2-year target: 340 new customers.</p>

        <p>That analysis is defensible. Each number traces back to actual data and reasonable assumptions. An investor can question the assumptions, but they can't dismiss the methodology.</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>We discuss your product, ideal customer profile, geographic focus, and how you plan to use the analysis. Board presentation? Fundraising? Territory planning? The use case shapes the deliverable.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Criteria Definition</strong><br>We document the specific filters for TAM, SAM, and SOM. Industry codes, employee ranges, revenue thresholds, geographic boundaries, technology requirements. Everything gets explicit so the analysis is reproducible.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Pull and Enrichment</strong><br>We query our database of company records, apply your criteria, and enrich with missing firmographic data. You get actual counts at each level.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Analysis and Delivery</strong><br>We deliver a complete analysis with TAM, SAM, and SOM calculations, methodology documentation, and the underlying company list. You can segment, re-filter, and use the data for targeting.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Iteration (if needed)</strong><br>Markets change. Your ICP evolves. We can update the analysis quarterly or as your strategy shifts.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>TAM SAM SOM analysis starts at $2,500 for a single market segment. This includes criteria definition, data pull, enrichment, analysis, and delivery of the company list.</p>

        <p>Multi-segment analyses (different products, geographies, or customer types) are priced based on complexity. Most projects fall in the $2,500-$5,000 range.</p>

        <p>Need ongoing market intelligence? We offer quarterly refresh packages at discounted rates.</p>

        <p><a href="/pricing.html">See full pricing details</a></p>

        <h2>Why TAM SAM SOM Accuracy Matters</h2>

        <h3>For Fundraising</h3>

        <p>Investors pattern-match against thousands of pitches. When they see inflated market numbers, they discount everything else you say. A credible, bottom-up TAM SAM SOM analysis signals that you understand your market deeply. It's the difference between "we're going after a huge market" and "we've identified 8,200 organizations that fit our ICP and here's how we'll capture 4% in year one."</p>

        <h3>For Board Reporting</h3>

        <p>Board members want to understand market opportunity relative to your penetration. If your SAM is 8,200 companies and you have 180 customers, your board knows you're at 2.2% penetration with significant room to grow. That's a strategic conversation. "The market is $47 billion" is not.</p>

        <h3>For Go-to-Market Planning</h3>

        <p>You can't plan territories around imaginary numbers. When you know there are exactly 2,400 target companies in the Northeast and 1,800 in the West, you can allocate reps accordingly. Real company counts drive real planning.</p>

        <h3>For Product Strategy</h3>

        <p>Understanding your SAM composition reveals product opportunities. If 60% of your SAM uses a specific technology stack, that integration becomes a priority. If 40% are in a sub-vertical you haven't targeted, there's expansion potential. The data tells you where to focus.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What is the difference between TAM, SAM, and SOM?</h3>
          <p>TAM (Total Addressable Market) is everyone who could theoretically buy your product. SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) is the portion you can realistically reach given your business model, geography, and capabilities. SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) is what you can realistically capture in the near term, typically 1-3 years, accounting for competition and sales capacity.</p>

          <h3>Why do investors scrutinize TAM SAM SOM numbers?</h3>
          <p>Investors have seen thousands of pitch decks with inflated market sizes. When founders cite massive TAMs without showing methodology, it signals either poor market understanding or deliberate misdirection. Bottom-up analysis with real company counts demonstrates that you've done the work to understand your opportunity.</p>

          <h3>How does Verum calculate TAM SAM SOM differently?</h3>
          <p>Instead of using industry reports with broad estimates, we use bottom-up methodology with actual company counts. We identify every company that matches your TAM criteria, filter by your ICP for SAM, then apply realistic capture assumptions for SOM. You get a list of actual companies, not just numbers.</p>

          <h3>How long does a TAM SAM SOM analysis take?</h3>
          <p>Most projects complete in 3-5 business days. This includes criteria definition, data pull and enrichment, analysis, and delivery of both the findings and the underlying company list. Complex multi-segment analyses may take 5-7 days.</p>
