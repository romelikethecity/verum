<h2>Tam Sam Som Analysis</h2>
<p>TAM/SAM/SOM analysis quantifies your market opportunity at three levels: total addressable market, serviceable addressable market, and serviceable obtainable market. We build this analysis from actual company and contact data rather than top-down revenue estimates from industry reports.</p>

<p>Your board deck says your TAM is $5 billion. The number came from an analyst report about your broader industry. But how many actual companies fit your ICP? How many of those can you realistically reach? How many can you win this year? Top-down TAM numbers don't answer these operational questions.</p>

<h2>How We Build TAM/SAM/SOM</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TAM definition.</strong> We count every company that could theoretically use your product based on broad criteria: industry, minimum company size, and geographic market.</li>
    <li><strong>SAM filtering.</strong> We narrow to companies you can realistically serve based on your product's requirements, pricing model, geographic reach, and sales capacity.</li>
    <li><strong>SOM estimation.</strong> We estimate what portion of the SAM you can capture in a given timeframe based on competition density, sales cycle length, and your current win rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Segment decomposition.</strong> We break each tier into sub-segments by industry, geography, and company size so you can see where the concentration of opportunity is highest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TAM/SAM/SOM Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bottom-up market sizing backed by actual company counts at each level</li>
    <li>Segment-level breakdown showing which sub-markets have the highest density of target companies</li>
    <li>Contact-level sizing showing how many decision-makers exist in your addressable market</li>
    <li>A data-backed market analysis that stands up to investor and board scrutiny</li>
</ul>

            <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);">Top-down starts with total industry revenue and estimates your share. Bottom-up counts actual companies that match your ICP criteria. Top-down usually overestimates because it includes companies that would never buy your product. Bottom-up gives you a realistic count that you can actually turn into a prospect list.</p>
