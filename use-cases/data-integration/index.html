        <h2>The Data Integration Problem</h2>

        <p>You're trying to merge data from five different systems. CRM, marketing automation, support ticketing, billing, and that spreadsheet someone's been maintaining since 2019. Sounds straightforward. Export, merge, import.</p>

        <p>Then you open the exports. System A calls it "Email." System B calls it "email_address." System C calls it "Email Address." System D has it split into three columns. The spreadsheet has it in a column labeled "Contact Info" along with phone numbers and mailing addresses.</p>

        <p>Phone formats are even worse. (555) 123-4567. 555-123-4567. +1 5551234567. 555.123.4567. The same phone number, five different formats, none of which match when you try to merge.</p>

        <p>A $950M medical device company faced exactly this problem. They had 120,000+ contact records spread across six states. Five different data vendors had touched their database over the years: BetterContact, Clay, FullEnrich, FastPeople, ZoomInfo. Each vendor had different conventions.</p>

        <h3>What we discovered</h3>

        <p>70+ different column names for 22 actual data fields. "Fuell Enrich Email" (a typo that had propagated through the system). "First Name," "FirstName," "first_name," "Name_First." The same field, seven different variations, impossible to merge without mapping.</p>

        <p>Phone numbers were losing their first digit during formatting. A number entered as 555-123-4567 was becoming 55-123-4567 somewhere in the export-import cycle. Bad data silently corrupting good data.</p>

        <p>We built a standardization pipeline that mapped all 70+ column variations to 22 canonical fields. Normalized all phone formats. Fixed the digit-dropping bug. Preserved vendor attribution so they could track which source provided which data.</p>

        <p>What would have taken a contractor 60 weeks of manual work, we completed in days.</p>

        <h2>What We Do for Data Integration</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Column mapping and standardization.</strong> We map all your field variations to consistent names. Email, email_address, and Email Address all become the same field. No more merge conflicts.</li>

          <li><strong>Format normalization.</strong> Phone numbers, dates, addresses, names. We standardize formats so data from different sources can actually be combined.</li>

          <li><strong>Duplicate detection across sources.</strong> The same record in different systems with slightly different data. We identify matches using exact and fuzzy matching, then help you merge correctly.</li>

          <li><strong>Data type validation.</strong> Numbers stored as text. Dates in wrong formats. Booleans as "Yes"/"No"/"Y"/"N"/"1"/"0". We fix the type mismatches that break integrations.</li>

          <li><strong>Source attribution preservation.</strong> When merging data from multiple vendors, you need to know which vendor provided which data. We preserve that provenance through the cleaning process.</li>

          <li><strong>Encoding and character handling.</strong> Smart quotes, special characters, UTF-8 versus ASCII. The encoding issues that cause silent data corruption get caught and fixed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your data exports.</strong> From all the systems you're trying to integrate. We work with whatever formats they export.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze and document the mess.</strong> Before cleaning anything, you'll see exactly what inconsistencies exist. Field naming variations. Format conflicts. Duplicate overlaps.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Standardization pipeline.</strong> We build mapping logic specific to your data. Not generic cleaning, but transformations designed for your particular integration challenge.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA on edge cases.</strong> Automation handles the patterns. Humans review the exceptions. Records that could match multiple ways. Fields with ambiguous data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Integration-ready data returned.</strong> Consistent formats. Standardized field names. Duplicates identified. Ready to merge without the usual nightmare.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Data integration cleanup runs $0.02-0.10 per record, depending on how many sources you're merging and how inconsistent the data is. Simple two-system merges are lower. Five-vendor consolidations with heavy format issues are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your exports.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What does data integration cleanup involve?</h3>
          <p>We standardize field formats across all your source systems, create consistent column mappings, deduplicate records, and ensure data from different sources can be merged cleanly.</p>

          <h3>Can you handle data from multiple vendors?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Different data vendors format things differently. One puts phone numbers as (555) 123-4567, another as +1 5551234567. We normalize everything to consistent formats so merging works.</p>

          <h3>What if we're migrating to a new CRM?</h3>
          <p>That's a perfect time to clean data. Migrating dirty data just moves the mess to a new system. We clean and standardize before migration so you start fresh.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle duplicate records across systems?</h3>
          <p>We use both exact matching and fuzzy matching to identify duplicates. john.smith@company.com from System A and jsmith@company.com from System B might be the same person. We catch those.</p>

        <h2>Ready to Integrate Without the Pain?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Planning an integration?</strong> Tell us what systems you're merging. We'll give you an honest assessment of what cleanup will be needed.</p>

        <p><strong>Already stuck?</strong> Send us your exports. We'll show you what clean, integration-ready data looks like.</p>
