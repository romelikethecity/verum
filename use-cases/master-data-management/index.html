        <h2>The Master Data Problem</h2>

        <p>You have five systems with customer data. CRM. Marketing automation. Support tickets. Billing. Analytics. Each has its own version of reality. None of them agree.</p>

        <p>Salesforce says Acme Corp has 500 employees. HubSpot says 250. The billing system has them as "Acme Corporation" with no employee count at all. Your support system shows three separate accounts for what's obviously the same company.</p>

        <p>So when the CEO asks "How many customers do we have?" you get five different answers depending on which system you pull from. Revenue reports don't match between finance and sales. Marketing thinks they're targeting 10,000 accounts while sales says they have 15,000. Everyone's right according to their system. Everyone's wrong according to reality.</p>

        <p>A $950M medical device company we worked with had exactly this problem. 120,000+ contact records scattered across six states. Five different data vendors had touched the database over the years. Each had left their own formatting conventions behind.</p>

        <h3>What we discovered</h3>

        <p>70+ different column names for 22 actual data fields. The same person appearing multiple times because one record had "John Smith" and another had "J. Smith" and a third had "Smith, John." Phone numbers in seven different formats. Email addresses with typos that had propagated through imports and exports for years.</p>

        <p>There was no master record. Just competing versions of the truth in every system. Reports were unreliable. Analytics were fiction. Territory assignments were guesswork because nobody could agree on which accounts actually existed.</p>

        <p>We built a canonical data model. Mapped all 70+ column variations to 22 standardized fields. Identified and merged duplicates. Established a single authoritative record for each contact and company. Now their systems pull from one source of truth, not five conflicting versions.</p>

        <h2>What We Do for Master Data Management</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Duplicate identification and merge.</strong> Find the records that represent the same entity across all your systems. Exact matches and fuzzy matches. Then merge them into a single master record with the best data from each source.</li>

          <li><strong>Field standardization.</strong> Create consistent formats for names, addresses, phone numbers, emails. Not just cleaning. Establishing the canonical format that all systems should use.</li>

          <li><strong>Missing data enrichment.</strong> Fill the gaps in your master records. If company size is missing, we add it. If industry is blank, we fill it. Complete master records, not partial ones.</li>

          <li><strong>Parent/subsidiary mapping.</strong> Know which accounts are actually divisions of the same organization. Create hierarchies that reflect reality. One master record per organization with proper relationships.</li>

          <li><strong>Golden record selection.</strong> When duplicates have conflicting data, which value wins? We help establish rules and apply them consistently. Most recent update. Most complete record. Source hierarchy. Whatever logic makes sense for your business.</li>

          <li><strong>Data lineage documentation.</strong> Track where each data point came from. When your master record says employee count is 500, you can trace that back to the original source and timestamp.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us exports from all your systems.</strong> CRM, MAP, billing, support, wherever customer data lives. We work with whatever formats they export.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We map and analyze.</strong> Before merging anything, you'll see exactly how the systems overlap. Duplicate counts. Field coverage by source. Conflicting data points.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Build the master data model.</strong> We design the canonical schema. Which fields matter. What formats to use. How to handle conflicts.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Dedupe, merge, and enrich.</strong> Create single master records from multiple system records. Fill missing data from external sources. Validate everything.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Master data delivered.</strong> Clean, deduplicated, standardized. Ready to be the single source of truth for all your systems.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Master data management projects run $0.05-0.20 per record, depending on how many systems you're unifying and how messy the data is. Simple two-system consolidations are lower. Five-source MDM projects with heavy deduplication are higher.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after analyzing your exports.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What does master data management cleanup involve?</h3>
          <p>We identify and merge duplicate records, standardize field formats, fill in missing data, and create a clean master record for each entity. The goal is one accurate record per customer that all systems can reference.</p>

          <h3>How do you handle duplicates that exist across multiple systems?</h3>
          <p>We use both exact matching and fuzzy matching to identify duplicates. The same company might appear as "Acme Corp" in one system and "ACME Corporation" in another. We catch those variations.</p>

          <h3>Can you help establish data governance going forward?</h3>
          <p>We focus on cleaning existing data, not building governance frameworks. But we document what we find and standardize, which gives your team a baseline for defining rules going forward.</p>

          <h3>What's the difference between MDM and data cleaning?</h3>
          <p>Data cleaning fixes individual records. MDM creates a single source of truth by deduplicating, standardizing, and establishing which record is authoritative when conflicts exist. We do both.</p>

        <h2>Ready for a Single Source of Truth?</h2>

        <p>Two options:</p>

        <p><strong>Not sure how bad it is?</strong> Tell us which systems have customer data. We'll give you an honest assessment of what unifying them will take.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to create master data?</strong> Send us your exports. We'll show you what a single source of truth looks like.</p>
