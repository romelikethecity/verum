        <h2>The Market Sizing Problem</h2>

        <p>You're preparing for a board meeting or investor pitch. You need to show your market opportunity. So you do what everyone does: buy an industry report, find a big number, and put it on a slide.</p>

        <p>The problem? That number is almost certainly wrong for your business. Industry reports measure total market spend, not companies you can actually sell to. They count enterprise giants and mom-and-pop shops in the same bucket. They include geographies you'll never enter and verticals where your product doesn't fit.</p>

        <p>When an investor asks "how many companies is that?" or "what percentage of that market can you realistically capture?", vague answers kill deals.</p>

        <h3>Industry reports give you dollars, not companies</h3>
        <p>A report might tell you the "HR software market" is worth $30 billion globally. Useful for context, useless for planning. How many companies are in that market? What percentage are in your target size range? How many are in regions you can serve? The report doesn't say. It was never designed to answer operational questions.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/sizing-markets-is-more-art-than-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Business Review research</a>, most startups overestimate their addressable market by 3-5x because they confuse total market spending with realistic opportunity. The difference between "companies that spend money in this category" and "companies we can actually win" is where deals fall apart.</p>

        <h3>Top-down sizing looks professional but crumbles under scrutiny</h3>
        <p>Top-down market sizing starts big and works backward. Take the industry total, apply some percentage assumptions, arrive at a number that sounds reasonable. The math is clean. The logic is linear. And it's exactly what investors have seen a thousand times before.</p>

        <p>The problem is that every assumption compounds. If you assume 30% of the market is in your target segment, 50% is in your geography, and 20% is in your deal size range, you've already made three assumptions that could each be off by 2x. Suddenly your $50B TAM is actually $5B. Or $500M. Nobody knows because nobody counted.</p>

        <h3>Fundraising demands defensible numbers</h3>
        <p>VCs see hundreds of decks per year. They've heard "TAM is $XX billion" in every single one. What separates serious founders from everyone else? The ability to explain exactly how they arrived at their market size, and to answer follow-up questions with data instead of hand-waving.</p>

        <p>A <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/venture-capital-due-diligence-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CB Insights analysis</a> of VC due diligence found that market sizing is one of the top five areas where startups fail to provide adequate evidence. Investors don't need perfect numbers, but they need to see that you understand your market at a granular level. "I can name 500 companies in my SAM and have already sold to 12 of them" beats "analysts say this market is growing 25% annually."</p>

          <a href="/#contact" class="btn btn--secondary">See What Accurate Market Sizing Looks Like</a>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Market Sizing Matters Beyond Fundraising</h2>

        <p>Accurate market sizing isn't just for pitch decks. It's operational infrastructure for every go-to-market decision you'll make.</p>

        <h3>Territory planning without data is guesswork</h3>
        <p>You're hiring your first AE in the Midwest. How many accounts should they own? Without knowing how many companies match your ICP in that region, you're guessing. Give them too few and they'll be bored. Too many and they'll cherry-pick the obvious ones while leaving money on the table.</p>

        <p>With accurate company counts by geography, you can balance territories fairly, set realistic quotas, and identify regions where you're under-invested.</p>

        <h3>Go-to-market strategy depends on market reality</h3>
        <p>Should you go upmarket or down? Expand to EMEA or double down on North America? Add a vertical or stay horizontal? These are million-dollar decisions. And the answer depends on knowing where the companies actually are.</p>

        <p>If there are 50,000 SMBs that match your ICP but only 500 enterprises, a high-velocity sales motion makes more sense than building an enterprise sales team. If 60% of your target companies are in three metros, field sales might work. If they're distributed across 1,000 cities, inside sales wins. The strategy follows the data.</p>

        <h3>Product roadmap should reflect market structure</h3>
        <p>Your product team wants to build an integration. Which one? If you know that 40% of your target market uses Salesforce, 30% uses HubSpot, and 15% uses Pipedrive, the priority is obvious. Without market composition data, you're building features based on who's loudest in your existing customer base, which might not represent the broader opportunity.</p>

        <h2>Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Market Sizing</h2>

        <p>There are two fundamentally different approaches to market sizing. Most companies use top-down because it's faster. The ones who win use bottom-up because it's accurate.</p>

        <h3>Top-down approach</h3>
        <p>Start with an industry total from Gartner, Forrester, or similar. Apply percentage assumptions to narrow down to your segment. The result is a number that sounds big and impressive but has no operational value.</p>

        <p>The calculation might look like: $100B total market, times 20% in target segment, times 30% in North America, times 15% in the right company size equals $900M TAM. Clean math. But where did those percentages come from? Usually thin air, informed by optimism.</p>

        <h3>Bottom-up approach</h3>
        <p>Start with actual companies. Count how many exist in each segment you care about. Multiply by realistic contract value. The result is a number you can defend because it's built from real data.</p>

        <p>The calculation looks like: 15,000 mid-market SaaS companies in North America, times $50K average contract value, equals $750M addressable market. An investor can ask "where did 15,000 come from?" and you can show them the list. That's defensible.</p>

        <h3>Why bottom-up wins</h3>
        <p>Bottom-up market sizing does two things top-down can't. First, it creates accountability. If you say there are 15,000 target companies, you should be able to produce them. That forces rigor into the analysis. Second, it converts directly into territory planning, account assignment, and sales operations. The same data that sizes your market becomes the list you sell into.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Enables Accurate Market Sizing</h2>

        <p>We provide the company-level data that makes bottom-up market sizing possible. Not aggregate statistics. Not industry estimates. Actual company records with the firmographic attributes you need to define your market.</p>

        <h3>Company counts by industry vertical</h3>
        <p>Need to know how many companies operate in healthcare IT? Commercial real estate? Industrial manufacturing? We can segment by NAICS codes, SIC codes, or custom industry definitions. You get actual counts, not percentage estimates.</p>

        <h3>Segmentation by company size</h3>
        <p>Employee count ranges. Revenue bands. Growth stage. We enrich company records with firmographic data so you can slice the market however you need. How many 50-200 employee software companies exist in the US? We can tell you.</p>

        <h3>Geographic breakdowns</h3>
        <p>Country-level. State and region. Metro area. Even down to territory-level analysis. If you need to know how many target companies exist within a 100-mile radius of Chicago, we can build that view.</p>

        <h3>Custom criteria for your ICP</h3>
        <p>Maybe you only sell to companies with a marketing team. Or companies that have raised venture funding. Or companies using specific technologies. We can filter by any attribute in our database and append missing data to create the exact segmentation your market sizing requires.</p>

        <h2>The Market Sizing Process</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Define Your Criteria (30 minutes)</strong><br>
        We start with your ICP definition. What industries? What company sizes? What geographies? What other attributes matter? If you don't have a formal ICP, we can help you develop one based on your best customers.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Data Collection and Enrichment (3-5 days)</strong><br>
        We pull company records matching your criteria from our database and enrich them with missing firmographic data. This isn't a sample. It's a comprehensive count of every company that matches your definition.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Segmentation Analysis (2-3 days)</strong><br>
        We break down the universe by whatever dimensions matter to you. TAM, SAM, SOM. By geography. By size tier. By vertical. You get counts for each segment, not just totals.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Deliverable and Walkthrough (1 day)</strong><br>
        You receive a full market sizing report with methodology documentation. We walk you through the analysis, answer questions, and help you understand how to use the data for planning. If you want the underlying company list for sales use, that's available too.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Market sizing projects are priced based on scope. A single-segment analysis for one geography starts around $3,500. Multi-segment analyses with territory breakdowns and company-level deliverables range from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on complexity.</p>

        <p>We also offer ongoing market monitoring for companies that need regular updates as they expand into new segments or geographies.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Market Sizing</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up market sizing?</h3>
          <p>Top-down market sizing starts with industry reports and works backward using assumptions. You take a big number and apply percentages to narrow it down. Bottom-up market sizing counts actual companies that match your criteria, then multiplies by realistic contract values. Bottom-up is more defensible because it uses real data rather than analyst estimates. When an investor asks "how did you get that number?", bottom-up gives you a clear answer.</p>

          <h3>How accurate are industry reports for market sizing?</h3>
          <p>Industry reports often miss 30-50% of relevant companies, especially in fragmented markets or emerging categories. They're designed to measure total spending, not count companies. A report might tell you the market is $30 billion but say nothing about how many companies that represents. For investor-grade market sizing, you need actual company data to validate report assumptions.</p>

          <h3>What data do I need for accurate market sizing?</h3>
          <p>You need company counts segmented by the attributes that define your addressable market: industry, company size (employees or revenue), geography, and any vertical-specific criteria. You also need realistic assumptions about what percentage is actually addressable, what your average deal size is, and what win rates look like. We provide the company-level data. You bring the go-to-market assumptions.</p>

          <h3>How long does a market sizing analysis take?</h3>
          <p>A typical project takes 1-2 weeks depending on complexity. Simple single-segment analyses can be completed faster, sometimes within a week. Multi-geography or multi-vertical analyses with territory planning may take 2-3 weeks. We provide company counts and firmographic breakdowns, not just aggregate numbers, so the deliverable has real operational value.</p>
