<h2>Market Sizing</h2>
<p>Market sizing quantifies the total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market (SAM), and serviceable obtainable market (SOM) for your product or service. Accurate sizing requires clean data on companies, contacts, and market segments — not back-of-envelope estimates.</p>

<p>Your investor deck says your TAM is $10 billion based on an industry report. But you can't tell them how many actual companies fit your ICP, how many decision-makers exist at those companies, or what percentage of the market you can realistically capture. You have a number but not the data behind it.</p>

<h2>How We Size Markets With Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TAM quantification.</strong> We count the total number of companies and contacts in your market based on firmographic criteria: industry, size, geography, and other filters you define.</li>
    <li><strong>SAM narrowing.</strong> We filter down to companies you can actually serve based on your product's requirements, geographic reach, and go-to-market capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact density.</strong> We estimate how many decision-makers exist per company in your target segment, giving you a realistic view of the contact-level market.</li>
    <li><strong>Segment breakdown.</strong> We break the market into sub-segments by industry, geography, company size, and other dimensions so you can prioritize where to focus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Market Sizing Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A concrete TAM, SAM, and SOM backed by actual company counts rather than revenue estimates from analyst reports</li>
    <li>Market breakdown by segment showing where the density of target companies is highest</li>
    <li>Contact-level sizing showing how many decision-makers exist in your target market</li>
    <li>Data you can use in investor presentations, board meetings, and strategic planning with confidence</li>
</ul>

Bottom-up data-driven sizing counts actual companies that match your criteria. Top-down often overestimates because it includes companies that would never buy your product.
