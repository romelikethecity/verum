        <h2>The Lead Scoring Problem</h2>

        <p>You've built a lead scoring model. Points for company size. Points for industry. Points for job title. Points for engagement. The model makes sense on paper.</p>

        <p>But look at the underlying data. Industry is blank for a third of your leads. Company size is whatever someone self-reported three years ago. Half your "enterprise" leads are actually 50-person companies because the form field said "500+" and people rounded up.</p>

        <p>So your scores are fiction. A lead from a perfect-fit company gets a low score because the firmographic fields are empty. A lead from a terrible-fit company gets a high score because they clicked three emails. Your sales team wastes time on high-scoring leads that were never going to close.</p>

        <p>A B2B platform we worked with had exactly this problem. They had scoring rules based on company size, industry, and engagement. Reasonable factors. But when we analyzed their 315 closed deals, we found something surprising.</p>

        <h3>What actually predicted success</h3>

        <p>Company size barely mattered. Industry was a weak signal. The strongest predictor of customer success was something they'd never considered scoring on: RevOps team structure.</p>

        <p>Companies with exactly two RevOps people had $8,750 lifetime value and 62% win rates. Companies with one RevOps person had $2,100 LTV but 68% win rates. Companies with three or more? 55% churn within the first year.</p>

        <p>Their scoring model had been giving equal points to all three segments. Same company size. Same industry. Same engagement level. Wildly different outcomes.</p>

        <p>We also found CRM platform was massively predictive. Dynamics CRM users closed at 99%. Pipedrive users closed at 7%. That's not a scoring adjustment of a few points. That's the difference between "drop everything to call them" and "maybe don't bother."</p>

        <p>The problem wasn't their scoring logic. The problem was they didn't have the data to score on the attributes that actually mattered.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What We Provide for Lead Scoring</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Standardized codes so your industry scoring actually works. Not self-reported categories. Not free text that varies by whoever filled out the form.</li>

          <li><strong>Company size tiers.</strong> Employee count and revenue ranges from multiple verified sources. Score on actual company size, not what someone claimed on a form years ago.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use today. If CRM platform predicts your wins, you need to know what CRM they're using. Score on tech fit, not just demographic fit.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth signals.</strong> Recent funding, headcount changes, expansion news. Companies actively investing often close faster. Score on trajectory, not just current state.</li>

          <li><strong>Organizational data.</strong> Team structure, department sizes, reporting relationships. If "two RevOps people" predicts your best customers, you need that data point.</li>

          <li><strong>Custom attributes.</strong> If something predicts success for you and exists in public data, we can probably find it. Job posting patterns, tech adoption signals, whatever matters for your model.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your lead data.</strong> Export from Salesforce, HubSpot, Marketo, or send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze coverage gaps.</strong> Before enriching anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Which scoring fields are blank. How many leads can't be scored accurately.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, LinkedIn, SEC filings, job postings, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Industry classifications that need judgment. Company sizes that don't match public data.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Scoring-ready data returned.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to import. Your scoring model finally has complete data to work with.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Lead scoring enrichment runs $0.10-0.50 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full firmographic plus technographic enrichment is at the higher end. Single-field projects are lower.</p>

        <p>For ICP analysis to identify which attributes actually predict wins, projects start at $1,500. We'll tell you what to score on, not just fill in the blanks.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What data do you provide for lead scoring?</h3>
          <p>We provide firmographic data (industry, company size, revenue), technographic data (tech stack, tools in use), and behavioral signals (funding, growth, hiring patterns). Everything your scoring model needs.</p>

          <h3>Can you help identify which attributes actually predict conversion?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Our ICP analysis service examines your win/loss data to find which attributes correlate with closed deals. You might be scoring on company size when tech stack matters more.</p>

          <h3>How is this different from behavioral scoring?</h3>
          <p>Behavioral scoring shows interest. Firmographic scoring shows fit. A lead from a perfect-fit company who's barely engaged is often more valuable than an engaged lead from a company that will never buy. You need both.</p>

          <h3>What if half my leads are missing firmographic data?</h3>
          <p>That's common. If industry is blank for 40% of leads, your industry-based scoring is only working on 60% of your pipeline. We typically see 85-95% match rates after enrichment.</p>
