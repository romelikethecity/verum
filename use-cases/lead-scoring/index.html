<h2>Lead Scoring</h2>
<p>Lead scoring assigns a value to each lead based on how well they match your ideal customer profile and how engaged they are with your content. Scoring breaks down when the profile data is incomplete — you can't score on company size if half your leads are missing that field.</p>

<p>You built a lead scoring model that weights industry (20 points), company size (15 points), title seniority (15 points), and engagement (50 points). But 40% of leads are missing industry. Title is unstandardized so 'VP' gets points but 'Vice President' doesn't. Your model scores 60% of leads incorrectly because the data inputs are unreliable.</p>

<h2>How We Fix Scoring Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Firmographic completion.</strong> We fill in company size, industry, revenue, and location fields that your scoring model uses for fit scoring. No more zero-score leads that are actually a perfect fit.</li>
    <li><strong>Title standardization.</strong> We map every title to consistent seniority and function values so VP and Vice President both score the same points. No more scoring gaps from title variations.</li>
    <li><strong>Data verification.</strong> We confirm that existing data is accurate. A lead scored as enterprise because someone typed '5000' instead of '50' for employee count is a costly scoring error.</li>
    <li><strong>Enrichment with scoring dimensions.</strong> We add fields like tech stack, funding status, and growth signals that can power more sophisticated scoring models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Better Scoring Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Scoring that accurately predicts fit because every firmographic field in the model is filled and verified</li>
    <li>Consistent scoring across all leads because title and industry values are standardized</li>
    <li>More nuanced scoring models because enrichment adds new dimensions beyond basic firmographics</li>
    <li>Sales confidence in lead scores because the data behind them is verifiably accurate</li>
    <li>Higher conversion rates from MQLs to SQLs because scoring correctly identifies the best leads</li>
</ul>
