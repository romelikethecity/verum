        <h2>The Campaign Targeting Problem</h2>

        <p>You're running LinkedIn ads, Google campaigns, display retargeting. The platforms promise precision targeting. Pick an industry, select a company size, add some job titles. Launch.</p>

        <p>Then you look at the results. Half your clicks are from companies too small to afford you. A quarter are from industries you don't even serve. Your "enterprise" campaign is getting engagement from 15-person startups because LinkedIn's company size data isn't always accurate.</p>

        <p>The platforms give you their data. But their data doesn't know your ICP. It doesn't know that companies using Dynamics CRM convert at 99% while Pipedrive users convert at 7%. It doesn't know that two-person RevOps teams are your sweet spot. It just knows broad categories.</p>

        <p>A B2B platform we analyzed had been running campaigns for months targeting what they thought was their ideal customer profile. Company size 50-200. B2B SaaS. North America. Reasonable enough.</p>

        <h3>What the data revealed</h3>

        <p>When we analyzed their 315 closed deals, we found the attributes that actually predicted success had nothing to do with company size or industry. RevOps team structure was the biggest factor. Companies with exactly two RevOps people had $8,750 lifetime value. Companies with one RevOps person had $2,100 LTV. Companies with three or more? 55% churn rate.</p>

        <p>Their campaigns had been reaching plenty of companies in the 50-200 employee range. But within that range, they were equally targeting $8,750 LTV customers and high-churn disasters. Same ad spend. Wildly different outcomes.</p>

        <p>CRM platform mattered even more. Dynamics CRM users had a 99% win rate. Pipedrive users had 7%. They'd been spending equally on both segments because their targeting couldn't distinguish between them.</p>

        <h3>The opportunity</h3>

        <p>With complete firmographic and technographic data, you're not guessing. You're targeting the specific attributes that predict success. Upload custom audiences built from enriched data, not platform approximations. Exclude the segments that waste budget before they waste budget.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide for Campaign Targeting</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Industry classification.</strong> Standardized codes that match your targeting needs. Know exactly which verticals you're reaching. Build audiences by industry with confidence.</li>

          <li><strong>Company size tiers.</strong> Employee count and revenue ranges validated against multiple sources. Stop trusting self-reported data. Know the actual size of companies you're targeting.</li>

          <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> What tools they use today. Target accounts using competitors you can replace or platforms you integrate with. Exclude accounts using tools that signal poor fit.</li>

          <li><strong>Growth signals.</strong> Recent funding, headcount growth, expansion news. Target accounts actively investing in the problems you solve. Exclude accounts in contraction mode.</li>

          <li><strong>Geographic accuracy.</strong> Headquarters location versus office locations. Target where decisions get made, not where someone happened to fill out a form.</li>

          <li><strong>Custom attributes.</strong> If it exists in public data and predicts success for you, we can probably find it. Hiring patterns, tech adoption signals, organizational structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your target account list.</strong> Export from your CRM, marketing platform, or send us a spreadsheet. We work with whatever format you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We analyze coverage gaps.</strong> Before enriching anything, you'll see exactly what's missing. Which fields have low coverage. Where your targeting is flying blind.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enrichment from 50+ sources.</strong> We pull from company websites, LinkedIn, SEC filings, job postings, and proprietary databases. Multiple sources per field for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Human QA.</strong> Automation handles scale. Humans catch the edge cases. Industry classifications that need judgment. Companies that could fit multiple categories.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Campaign-ready data returned.</strong> Same format you sent, ready to build custom audiences. Complete profiles for every account in your target list.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Campaign targeting enrichment runs $0.10-0.50 per record, depending on which fields you need. Full firmographic plus technographic enrichment is at the higher end. Single-field projects are lower.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. We'll give you a fixed quote after seeing your data.</p>
