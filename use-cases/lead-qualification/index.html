        <p class="page-hero__subtitle">Your reps are qualifying leads with incomplete data. We fix the data so qualification is instant.</p>

<h2>Lead Qualification</h2>
<p>Lead qualification determines which leads deserve sales attention and which don't. When the data behind qualification is incomplete — missing company size, unknown industry, blank title field — your qualification is guesswork. Complete data makes qualification fast and accurate.</p>

<p>A lead comes in with a name and email. Your SDR spends 10 minutes looking up the company, figuring out the title, checking if they're in your target market. That's 10 minutes per lead that could be automated if the data fields were filled. Multiply by 50 leads a day and that's an entire day of research, not selling.</p>

<h2>How Clean Data Powers Qualification</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Instant firmographic context.</strong> We enrich leads with company size, revenue, industry, and location so your scoring model can evaluate fit the moment a lead arrives.</li>
    <li><strong>Title and seniority standardization.</strong> We normalize job titles to standard seniority and function levels so your qualification criteria work consistently across all title variations.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate checking.</strong> We flag leads that already exist in your CRM as contacts or previous leads, preventing your team from qualifying someone they've already spoken to.</li>
    <li><strong>Account matching.</strong> We match new leads to existing accounts so your team knows immediately whether this is a new logo opportunity or an expansion play at a current customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Qualification Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Leads qualified in seconds instead of minutes because every data field needed for scoring is pre-filled</li>
    <li>Consistent qualification criteria across all leads because title and firmographic data is standardized</li>
    <li>No wasted effort on duplicate leads because matches are flagged before a rep picks up the phone</li>
    <li>Higher pipeline quality because qualification is based on verified data, not form fills and assumptions</li>
    <li>Faster speed-to-lead because reps can start outreach immediately instead of researching</li>
</ul>
