        <h2>The Lead Qualification Problem</h2>

        <p>A lead comes in. Marketing automation assigns a score based on form fills and page views. Maybe they downloaded a whitepaper. Maybe they attended a webinar. The lead gets passed to sales with a note: "Hot lead. MQL."</p>

        <p>The SDR opens the record and sees: Name, email, company name. That's it. No employee count. No revenue range. No industry classification. No information about what technology they use, whether they've raised funding, or who makes purchasing decisions at their organization.</p>

        <p>So the rep starts researching. LinkedIn to find the company. Maybe Crunchbase for funding info. The company website to guess at employee count. G2 or BuiltWith to check their tech stack. Fifteen minutes later, they discover it's a 3-person startup with no budget, or a company in an industry you don't serve.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce's State of Sales report</a>, sales reps spend only 28% of their time actually selling. The rest goes to administrative tasks, internal meetings, and research. A significant chunk of that research time is spent gathering basic firmographic information that should already exist in the CRM.</p>

        <h3>The incomplete data problem compounds fast</h3>

        <p>Every lead that enters your system without proper firmographic data creates downstream problems. Marketing can't segment accurately. Lead scoring models miss the mark because they're working with incomplete inputs. Sales development reps waste time on companies that will never close. And when you try to analyze why deals win or lose, you're missing the data points that would tell you.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/trends/b2b-sales-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner's B2B buying research</a> shows that buying committees now average 6-10 decision makers. Without org chart data and title information, you might be talking to an influencer when you need the budget holder. Or reaching a manager when the VP makes the final call.</p>

        <h3>Manual qualification doesn't scale</h3>

        <p>The traditional approach to lead qualification involves discovery calls. Ask about company size. Ask about budget. Ask about timeline. Ask about decision-making process. This works when you have a handful of leads per week. It falls apart when marketing is generating hundreds or thousands of leads per month.</p>

        <p>Your reps can't call everyone. So they guess. They cherry-pick leads based on company names they recognize. They prioritize based on gut feel. Good leads slip through. Bad leads get attention they don't deserve. And nobody has visibility into why the qualification process is producing inconsistent results.</p>

        <h2>What Happens Without Proper Qualification Data</h2>

        <p>The costs of qualifying leads on incomplete data show up in multiple places, and they compound over time.</p>

        <h3>Wasted sales capacity</h3>

        <p>Every hour your SDR spends researching a lead that turns out to be unqualified is an hour they're not spending on leads that could close. If your average SDR handles 100 leads per month and 30% are unqualified, that's 30 discovery calls that were never going to produce pipeline. At even 30 minutes per call (plus prep and follow-up), you're losing 20+ hours per rep per month to leads that should have been filtered out automatically.</p>

        <p>For a team of 10 SDRs, that's 200 hours of wasted capacity every month. That's not a data problem. That's a headcount problem you're paying for without getting the output.</p>

        <h3>Missed opportunities</h3>

        <p>The flip side of spending time on bad leads is missing good ones. When reps are overwhelmed with volume, they make fast decisions about who to call. Without firmographic data to guide those decisions, prioritization becomes arbitrary. A startup that just raised Series B might sit in the queue while a rep chases a larger company that has no budget this quarter.</p>

        <p>Speed to lead matters. <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Business Review research</a> showed that companies who respond to leads within an hour are seven times more likely to qualify the lead than those who wait even two hours. When your reps are busy researching instead of calling, response times slip. Qualified leads go cold or choose competitors who responded faster.</p>

        <h3>Broken lead scoring</h3>

        <p>Lead scoring models are supposed to surface the leads most likely to convert. But models need inputs. If your scoring only considers behavioral data (pages visited, content downloaded, emails opened), you're only seeing half the picture. A VP at a 500-person company in your target industry who downloaded one whitepaper is probably more qualified than an individual contributor at a non-fit company who consumed ten pieces of content.</p>

        <p>Without firmographic data, your lead scoring is guessing at fit. That means marketing is passing leads that look engaged but aren't actually qualified. Sales loses trust in the MQL designation. The whole handoff process breaks down.</p>

        <h3>No accountability or optimization</h3>

        <p>When leads don't have firmographic data attached, you can't analyze what's working. Which industries close at the highest rate? What company size hits your pricing sweet spot? Do leads from funded companies close faster? You can't answer these questions without the data.</p>

        <p>This means you can't tell marketing which lead sources are producing quality. You can't adjust your ICP based on closed-won patterns. You're operating blind.</p>

        <h2>BANT and Other Frameworks Need Data</h2>

        <p>Sales qualification frameworks like BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline), MEDDIC, or CHAMP are supposed to standardize how reps evaluate opportunities. They give structure to discovery conversations. But every one of these frameworks assumes you have baseline information about the prospect before the call.</p>

        <h3>Budget requires financial context</h3>

        <p>When a rep asks about budget, they're trying to determine if this company can afford your solution. But budget capacity doesn't come from nowhere. A 10-person startup has different budget constraints than a 1,000-person enterprise. A company that just raised $50M has different spending power than one that's bootstrapped and cash-conservative.</p>

        <p>With firmographic data, you can pre-qualify budget fit before the first call. Employee count and revenue estimates give you a baseline. Recent funding rounds signal available capital. Your reps can skip the awkward budget conversation entirely for companies that obviously fit, and focus discovery time on the nuances that actually matter.</p>

        <h3>Authority requires org understanding</h3>

        <p>Knowing who makes decisions requires understanding the organization. At a 50-person company, the CEO might approve every software purchase. At a 5,000-person company, there are layers of approval and procurement processes to navigate.</p>

        <p>Enriched data tells you the company size and structure before you call. Title data helps you identify whether you're talking to the decision-maker or an influencer. Seniority indicators help you calibrate your pitch and determine who else needs to be in the conversation.</p>

        <h3>Need requires industry and tech context</h3>

        <p>Understanding whether a company has a need for your solution requires context about what they do and what they already use. Industry classification tells you if they're in a vertical you serve well. Technology stack data reveals whether they use complementary tools or competing solutions.</p>

        <p>A company already using your competitor might be a conquest opportunity or a waste of time depending on your win rate against that competitor. A company with no marketing automation might need to solve foundational problems before they're ready for your advanced solution. This context shapes whether and how you pursue the opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Timeline correlates with business events</h3>

        <p>Buying urgency doesn't appear randomly. It correlates with business events. New funding creates pressure to scale, which drives software purchases. Rapid hiring signals growth that often requires new tools. Leadership changes bring new priorities and budget reallocations.</p>

        <p>Firmographic enrichment can surface these signals. Recent funding rounds, job posting velocity, executive changes. These data points help you identify companies that are likely to have shorter sales cycles because they're in active buying mode.</p>

        <h2>How Verum Enables Lead Qualification</h2>

        <p>We enrich your lead data with the firmographic information sales teams actually need to qualify effectively. Not vanity metrics. The data points that determine fit and priority.</p>

        <h3>Company size and structure</h3>

        <p>Employee count and revenue estimates, verified across multiple sources. Not just a single data point, but triangulated information that you can trust. We flag confidence levels so you know when data is well-sourced versus estimated.</p>

        <p><strong>For lead qualification:</strong> Instantly filter leads by company size. Set thresholds that match your ICP. A 50-500 employee sweet spot? Leads outside that range get deprioritized automatically.</p>

        <h3>Industry classification</h3>

        <p>Standardized industry codes (NAICS, SIC) plus human-readable classifications. We normalize the messy industry data that comes from form fills and imports into consistent categories your systems can use.</p>

        <p><strong>For lead qualification:</strong> Route leads to the right reps based on industry expertise. Score leads higher when they match your target verticals. Filter out industries you don't serve.</p>

        <h3>Technology stack</h3>

        <p>What CRM do they use? What marketing automation? What cloud infrastructure? Technology data reveals both fit (do they use tools you integrate with?) and opportunity (are they using a competitor you displace well?).</p>

        <p><strong>For lead qualification:</strong> Prioritize leads using complementary technology. Identify competitive displacement opportunities. Qualify out companies on platforms you don't support.</p>

        <h3>Funding and financial signals</h3>

        <p>Recent funding rounds, total capital raised, and investor information. For public companies, basic financial metrics. This data correlates strongly with budget capacity and buying urgency.</p>

        <p><strong>For lead qualification:</strong> Fast-track recently funded companies. Adjust expectations based on financial profile. Identify companies in growth mode who are actively buying.</p>

        <h3>Decision-maker identification</h3>

        <p>Contact enrichment that includes titles, seniority levels, and reporting structure context. Not just the person who filled out the form, but who else at the company you should be talking to.</p>

        <p><strong>For lead qualification:</strong> Determine whether your contact has authority. Identify other stakeholders to engage. Map the buying committee before your first call.</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p>Getting started takes less time than your average discovery call.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Free Assessment (5 minutes)</strong><br>Tell us about your lead qualification challenges. What data are you missing? What's your current lead volume? What CRM or marketing automation do you use? We'll give you an honest assessment of what enrichment can realistically deliver.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)</strong><br>We dig into your ICP and qualification criteria. What firmographic attributes determine fit? What data points would change how you route or score leads? We'll map the enrichment requirements to your actual sales process, whether you're running leads through Salesforce, HubSpot, or another system.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Data Analysis (on us)</strong><br>Send us a sample of your leads. We'll analyze current data completeness, identify what's missing, and show you what enriched data would look like. No charge. This gives you a realistic preview before committing to a project.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Full Enrichment</strong><br>We enrich your lead database with the firmographic data points we've agreed on. AI handles the scale. Humans verify accuracy. You get data back in your preferred format, ready to import into your CRM or feed into your lead scoring model.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Ongoing (if you want it)</strong><br>Lead enrichment isn't a one-time project. New leads keep coming in. We can set up ongoing enrichment that processes new leads as they arrive, so your data stays complete without manual intervention.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Lead enrichment starts at $0.02-0.05 per record for standard firmographic data (company size, industry, location). More complex enrichment (technology stack, funding data, org chart mapping) runs $0.10-0.25 per record depending on scope.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. No annual contracts. No platform fees. You pay for the data you need, and you own it.</p>

        <p>Compare that to the cost of one SDR hour wasted on an unqualified lead. Or the opportunity cost of a good lead that went cold while your rep was researching instead of calling.</p>

        <h2>Verum vs. Buying a ZoomInfo Seat</h2>

        <p>You might be thinking: "Why not just buy ZoomInfo or Clearbit?" Fair question. Three differences:</p>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>$15K-$50K+ annual subscription</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Credits expire, data access ends when contract ends</td>
              <td>You own the enriched data forever</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Self-service; you do the work</td>
              <td>We do the enrichment for you</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Generic data, same as your competitors</td>
              <td>Custom research for hard-to-find companies</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Automated matching only</td>
              <td>Human QA on every project</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Platforms make sense if you need net-new prospecting lists at scale. But if you already have leads and just need them enriched, you're paying for capabilities you won't use. We clean and enrich the data you have. Different problem, different solution.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What firmographic data points are most important for lead qualification?</h3>
          <p>The most critical firmographic data points for qualification are: company size (employee count and revenue), industry, geographic location, funding status, and technology stack. These allow sales teams to quickly determine fit against their ICP and prioritize accordingly. The exact priority depends on your business, which is why we start with a discovery call to understand your qualification criteria.</p>

          <h3>How does firmographic enrichment improve BANT qualification?</h3>
          <p>BANT requires data about Budget (company revenue and funding suggest budget capacity), Authority (org charts and titles identify decision-makers), Need (industry and tech stack signal potential fit), and Timeline (funding rounds and hiring trends indicate buying readiness). Without enrichment, reps spend discovery calls gathering basic information instead of advancing the sale. With it, they walk into calls already knowing the fundamentals.</p>

          <h3>How accurate is firmographic data from enrichment services?</h3>
          <p>Data accuracy varies significantly by provider and data type. Employee count is typically 70-85% accurate within reasonable ranges. Revenue data is less reliable since it's often estimated from employee count. We triangulate across 50+ sources and apply human QA, targeting 93%+ accuracy on deliverable contact information. For firmographic data, we flag confidence levels so you know what's verified versus estimated.</p>

          <h3>How long does lead qualification data enrichment take?</h3>
          <p>Most lead enrichment projects complete within 24-48 hours for standard firmographic data. Larger datasets (50,000+ records) or complex enrichment requirements (custom research, hard-to-find companies) may take 3-5 business days. We provide timeline estimates before starting any project, so there are no surprises.</p>
