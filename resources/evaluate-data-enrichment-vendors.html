      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>Every data enrichment vendor has a slick demo. Great match rates on their sample data. Impressive database sizes in the hundreds of millions. Logos of companies you've heard of.</p>

        <p>Then you sign a 12-month contract, upload your first batch, and discover that the match rate on your actual data is half of what the sales rep promised.</p>

        <p>This happens because most companies evaluate vendors on demos instead of test data. Here are 8 questions that will tell you what a vendor can actually deliver before you commit.</p>

        <h2>1. What's Your Match Rate on My Data?</h2>

        <p>Not their sample data. Yours. The only match rate that matters is the one you get when you submit your actual records.</p>

        <p>Ask every vendor to run a test batch. Give them 500-1,000 records from your CRM. Compare the results side by side. You'll see dramatic differences between vendors who are strong in your market and vendors who aren't.</p>

        <div class="callout-box">
          <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Any vendor who won't run a free test batch is either not confident in their data or not serious about earning your business. Walk away.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Where Does Your Data Come From?</h2>

        <p>Ask specifically. "Multiple sources" is not an answer. You want to know:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Do they source from public records, web scraping, data partnerships, user contributions, or purchased datasets?</li>
          <li>How many distinct sources feed into their database?</li>
          <li>Do they verify data from those sources, or aggregate it as-is?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Vendors who source from a single channel (e.g., only web scraping or only user-contributed data) will have systematic blind spots. Multi-source vendors with verification layers deliver more reliable data.</p>

        <h2>3. How Do You Verify Email Addresses?</h2>

        <p>There's a massive quality difference between email pattern guessing and actual verification:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pattern guessing</strong> predicts emails based on name + domain format (firstname.lastname@company.com). Works for simple formats but fails on custom patterns and doesn't catch inactive mailboxes. Typical deliverability: 70-80%.</li>
          <li><strong>SMTP verification</strong> checks with the mail server whether the address exists and can receive mail. Catches inactive mailboxes, typos, and non-standard formats. Typical deliverability: 90-95%.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If a vendor says they "verify" emails, ask specifically whether they run SMTP checks or just pattern matching. The answer determines whether you'll see 8% or 20% bounce rates.</p>

        <h2>4. How Fresh Is Your Data?</h2>

        <p>B2B contact data decays at roughly 30% per year. If a vendor last refreshed a record 18 months ago, there's a significant chance the person has changed jobs.</p>

        <p>Ask:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How often are records re-verified?</li>
          <li>What triggers a data refresh? (Calendar-based vs. signal-based)</li>
          <li>Can you tell me the last verification date for records you deliver?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Good vendors refresh data at least quarterly. Great vendors use event-driven updates (job change signals, company news, website changes) to keep records current between scheduled refreshes.</p>

        <h2>5. What's Your Pricing Model?</h2>

        <p>Data enrichment pricing falls into three models:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Annual subscription:</strong> $15,000-100,000+/year for platform access with credit limits. Best for teams with daily usage.</li>
          <li><strong>Per-record pricing:</strong> $0.05-0.50 per enriched record. Best for periodic bulk operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Per-project pricing:</strong> Flat fee per engagement. Best for one-time cleanups or defined projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Match the pricing model to your usage pattern. If you need data twice a year, an annual subscription wastes money. If your team pulls contacts daily, per-record pricing might get expensive.</p>

        <h2>6. What Happens to Credits I Don't Use?</h2>

        <p>If the vendor uses credits or an annual allocation, ask what happens to unused credits. Most expire. Some roll over partially. A few offer refunds on unused allocation.</p>

        <p>Also ask: what counts as a "credit"? Some vendors charge a credit for a search (even if it returns no results). Others only charge when they deliver a match. This distinction can double or triple your effective cost per enriched record.</p>

        <h2>7. Do I Own the Data After Delivery?</h2>

        <p>Some vendors include deletion clauses that require you to remove data from your CRM if you cancel the contract. Others restrict how you can use or share enriched data.</p>

        <p>Read the data ownership section of the contract carefully. You want permanent ownership of any data delivered to you, with no deletion requirements and no re-licensing fees.</p>

        <h2>8. Can You Handle Cleaning and Enrichment Together?</h2>

        <p>Most companies need both. They have existing records that need deduplication and standardization (cleaning), plus fields that need to be filled in with missing information (enrichment).</p>

        <p>Many vendors only do one or the other. Enrichment-only vendors will append data to duplicate records, making the problem worse. Cleaning-only vendors will standardize your data but leave fields empty.</p>

        <p>If you need both, either find a vendor that does both or plan to coordinate two vendors sequentially (clean first, then enrich).</p>

        <h2>The Evaluation Process</h2>

        <p>Here's a practical evaluation workflow:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Define your requirements</strong> (target market, fields needed, volume, frequency)</li>
          <li><strong>Shortlist 3-4 vendors</strong> based on these 8 criteria</li>
          <li><strong>Run test batches</strong> with 500-1,000 of your real records</li>
          <li><strong>Compare results side by side</strong> (match rate, accuracy, fill rate by field)</li>
          <li><strong>Negotiate pricing</strong> based on your actual usage pattern</li>
          <li><strong>Start with a short-term commitment</strong> before signing annual contracts</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The test batch step is non-negotiable. Every vendor looks good in a demo. Only your actual data tells you which vendor will perform.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What should I look for in a data enrichment vendor?</h3>
        <p>Evaluate on match rate (using your data, not theirs), data freshness, verification methods (SMTP vs. pattern guessing), pricing model, and data ownership terms. Always run a test batch before committing.</p>

        <h3>What is a good match rate for data enrichment?</h3>
        <p>For US-based companies with 50+ employees, expect 70-85% email match rates and 50-70% direct dial coverage from a single source. Multi-source enrichment pushes email above 85% and phone above 70%.</p>

        <h3>Should I use one data enrichment vendor or multiple?</h3>
        <p>Multiple vendors almost always outperform a single vendor. No single source has complete coverage. Waterfall enrichment typically achieves 20-40% higher coverage than any individual provider.</p>
