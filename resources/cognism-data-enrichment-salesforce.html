      <div class="blog-content">

        <p>If you're evaluating <strong>Cognism for Salesforce data enrichment</strong>, you're probably comparing it against ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lusha, and a handful of other providers. Cognism has carved out a position as the GDPR-focused alternative with strong European coverage and phone-verified mobile numbers.</p>

        <p>But "GDPR-compliant with great European data" doesn't tell you much about how it performs for US B2B enrichment inside Salesforce. Here's what we've seen working with companies that use Cognism, have left Cognism, or are considering it.</p>

        <h2>What Cognism Offers for Salesforce</h2>

        <p>Cognism's Salesforce integration covers three main use cases:</p>

        <p><strong>Prospecting.</strong> Search Cognism's database by company, industry, title, location, and technology filters. Push matching contacts directly into Salesforce as Leads or Contacts. This is the primary use case and where Cognism puts most of its product investment.</p>

        <p><strong>Enrichment of existing records.</strong> Match your Salesforce Contacts and Accounts against Cognism's database to fill in missing fields: email, phone, title, company size, industry, revenue, and technology stack. This works through both manual (click to enrich) and bulk (batch process) workflows.</p>

        <p><strong>Data maintenance.</strong> Cognism can flag records where the contact's job title or company has changed, indicating the data is stale. This is useful but limited compared to dedicated data hygiene tools.</p>

        <h3>Diamond Data: Phone-Verified Mobiles</h3>

        <p>Cognism's differentiator is "Diamond Data," which refers to phone numbers that have been manually verified by their research team. They call the number, confirm it's the right person, and mark it as verified. For sales teams that rely on cold calling, this is valuable. Verified mobile numbers connect at significantly higher rates than scraped or modeled numbers.</p>

        <p>The limitation: Diamond Data coverage is concentrated in their strongest markets (UK, DACH, Benelux). US coverage for Diamond Data is thinner, especially outside enterprise companies.</p>

        <h2>Where Cognism Performs Well</h2>

        <p><strong>European coverage.</strong> If your sales team targets EMEA, Cognism has some of the best coverage available. Their GDPR-compliant data collection process and DNC list integration across European countries is more thorough than most US-based competitors.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance posture.</strong> Cognism checks against global Do-Not-Call lists, maintains opt-out databases, and provides audit trails for how data was collected. For companies in regulated industries or with European data subjects, this matters.</p>

        <p><strong>Mobile number quality.</strong> When Diamond Data is available for your target contacts, the connection rates are noticeably better than ZoomInfo or Apollo mobile numbers. The verification process adds cost but reduces wasted dials.</p>

        <p><strong>Browser extension.</strong> Their Chrome extension works on LinkedIn profiles and company websites, letting reps grab contact data without leaving their browser. The data pushes directly to Salesforce.</p>

        <h2>Where Cognism Falls Short for Salesforce Enrichment</h2>

        <p><strong>US SMB coverage gaps.</strong> If you sell to companies under 500 employees in the US, expect match rates to disappoint. Cognism's database skews toward larger organizations, particularly in the US market. A 15-person software company in Austin or a 40-person manufacturing firm in Ohio may not exist in their database at all.</p>

        <p><strong>Enrichment depth is uneven.</strong> Email addresses are generally reliable. Phone numbers depend on Diamond Data availability. Firmographic data (revenue, employee count, technology stack) is sourced from third parties and can be stale. Don't expect every field to be filled on every record.</p>

        <p><strong>No data cleaning capabilities.</strong> Cognism enriches data; it doesn't clean it. It won't deduplicate your Salesforce Accounts, normalize company names, standardize job titles, or validate existing email addresses. If your CRM has years of accumulated data quality problems, enrichment alone doesn't solve them.</p>

        <p><strong>Annual contract, opaque pricing.</strong> Cognism requires an annual commitment. Pricing isn't published and varies by seat count, credit volume, and negotiation. Expect $15,000-25,000/year as a starting range. There's no monthly option and no per-record pricing. If your enrichment needs are periodic rather than constant, you're paying for a full year regardless.</p>

        <p><strong>Credit burn on non-matches.</strong> Depending on your plan, searching for contacts that don't exist in Cognism's database can still consume credits. Understand exactly how credits are counted before committing.</p>

        <div class="callout-box">
          <p><strong>The honest take:</strong> Cognism is a strong choice if you sell into EMEA and need verified phone numbers. For US-focused teams doing Salesforce enrichment, ZoomInfo has better coverage. For teams that need data cleaning alongside enrichment, neither platform covers it.</p>

        <h2>When Cognism Makes Sense for Salesforce</h2>

        <p><strong>Your team sells into Europe.</strong> Cognism's EMEA coverage and GDPR compliance posture are hard to beat. If your pipeline includes UK, Germany, France, or Benelux contacts, Cognism should be in your evaluation.</p>

        <p><strong>Cold calling is a primary channel.</strong> Diamond Data's verified mobile numbers produce measurably better connect rates. If your SDRs are making 50+ calls per day, the quality difference compounds.</p>

        <p><strong>You have budget for an annual platform.</strong> Cognism's pricing assumes consistent, ongoing use. If you're enriching new records weekly and prospecting daily, the per-record economics can work out.</p>

        <h2>When to Consider Alternatives</h2>

        <p><strong>You're US-focused and selling to SMB.</strong> ZoomInfo or Apollo will give you better coverage for smaller US companies. Cognism's US database is strongest for enterprise accounts.</p>

        <p><strong>You need data cleaning, not just enrichment.</strong> If your Salesforce has duplicate accounts, inconsistent company names, invalid emails, and stale records, you need cleaning before enrichment makes sense. Cognism doesn't do cleaning. Consider a <a href="/services/data-cleaning.html">data cleaning service</a> first, then evaluate enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Your enrichment needs are periodic.</strong> If you're doing a one-time cleanup or enriching a specific list rather than ongoing prospecting, an annual platform contract doesn't make sense. Per-record services or pay-as-you-go tools are more cost-effective for project-based work.</p>

        <p><strong>You want someone to do the work.</strong> Cognism is a self-serve platform. You still need someone to manage the enrichment process, review match quality, handle edge cases, and sync data correctly to Salesforce. If you'd rather hand off the entire project, a managed service is a better fit.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How does Cognism's Salesforce integration work?</h3>
          <p>Cognism connects to Salesforce through a native integration. You can push prospecting contacts directly into your CRM, enrich existing records in bulk or one at a time, and receive alerts when contact data goes stale.</p>

          <h3>How much does Cognism cost?</h3>
          <p>Pricing isn't published. Annual contracts typically start around $15,000-25,000/year based on seat count and credit volume. Phone-verified Diamond Data costs additional credits. No monthly plans available.</p>

          <h3>Is Cognism better than ZoomInfo for Salesforce?</h3>
          <p>For EMEA: often yes. Cognism's European coverage and GDPR posture are stronger. For US-only teams: ZoomInfo typically wins on coverage, especially for SMB and mid-market. Both require annual commitments at similar price points.</p>

          <h3>What are alternatives to Cognism for Salesforce enrichment?</h3>
          <p>ZoomInfo ($15K+/yr, largest US database), Apollo ($49/mo+, budget-friendly), Lusha (direct dials, usage-based), Clay ($149/mo+, multi-provider waterfall), and <a href="/compare/verum-vs-cognism/">Verum</a> (done-for-you service, per-record pricing, no contract).</p>
