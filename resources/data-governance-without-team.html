          <h1>How to Build a Data Governance Process (Without a Full-Time Team)</h1>

          <p>Enterprise companies have data governance teams. They have data stewards and data quality analysts and people whose entire job is making sure data stays clean.</p>

          <p>You don't have that. You have a RevOps person who's also doing reporting, maybe some marketing ops bandwidth, and a Salesforce admin who's swamped with change requests. Nobody's job is data governance.</p>

          <p>Here's how to build a governance process that actually works without dedicated headcount.</p>

          <h2>What Governance Actually Means</h2>

          <p>Data governance sounds bureaucratic, and it can be if you let it. But at its core, it's just answering a few questions (what the <a href="https://www.dama.org/cpages/body-of-knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAMA-DMBOK framework</a> calls the "accountability" dimension of data management):</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Who can create and modify data?</li>
            <li>What standards should data meet?</li>
            <li>How do we know if data quality is getting worse?</li>
            <li>Who fixes problems when they're found?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>That's it. You don't need a committee or a formal charter or a multi-year roadmap. You need clear answers to those questions and lightweight processes to enforce them.</p>

          <h2>The Minimum Viable Governance Model</h2>

          <h3>1. Assign Ownership (Part-Time)</h3>

          <p>Someone has to be accountable for data quality. Not full-time, but accountable. When something goes wrong with data, who gets the Slack message?</p>

          <p>This is usually RevOps, Marketing Ops, or a Salesforce admin. It doesn't matter who specifically, but it needs to be someone with:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Access to the CRM and related systems</li>
            <li>Understanding of how data flows through your stack</li>
            <li>Authority to make changes (or escalate to someone who can)</li>
            <li>A few hours per month to dedicate to data quality</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If nobody is accountable, nothing will happen. That's the baseline.</p>

          <h3>2. Define Standards for Critical Fields</h3>

          <p>You don't need standards for every field. You need standards for fields that matter operationally:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> Required, must be valid format, ideally verified</li>
            <li><strong>Company/Account:</strong> Required for contacts, standardized naming convention</li>
            <li><strong>Lead Source:</strong> Required, from defined picklist values</li>
            <li><strong>Routing fields:</strong> Whatever your routing depends on (company size, industry, country, etc.)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Write these down. One page is enough. The point isn't documentation for its own sake. It's having a reference when someone asks "what should this field contain?"</p>

          <h3>3. Add Validation at Entry Points</h3>

          <p>The cheapest time to fix data quality is before bad data enters the system. Add validation where you can:</p>

          <p><strong>Web forms:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Required fields for what you actually need</li>
            <li>Email format validation (at minimum)</li>
            <li>Real-time email verification if your form tool supports it</li>
            <li>Picklists instead of free text where possible</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>List imports:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>All imports go through one person (the data owner)</li>
            <li>Required: email validation before import</li>
            <li>Required: duplicate check before import</li>
            <li>Standard field mapping template</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Manual entry:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Required fields enforced in CRM</li>
            <li>Validation rules for format where possible</li>
            <li>Training for anyone who creates records</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You won't catch everything. But catching 80% of problems at entry is far cheaper than cleaning them up later. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-07-13-gartner-says-poor-data-quality-is-a-leading-cause-of-crm-implementation-failures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner research</a> consistently finds that preventing bad data costs a fraction of cleaning it after the fact.</p>

          <h3>4. Monitor Key Metrics Monthly</h3>

          <p>You can't improve what you don't measure. Pick 3-5 key metrics and check them monthly:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Email validity rate (sample verification or track bounces)</li>
            <li>Duplicate rate (run duplicate detection monthly)</li>
            <li>Field completion for routing fields</li>
            <li>Contact-account association rate</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Build a simple report or dashboard. Takes 30 minutes to set up, 15 minutes to review each month. When metrics move in the wrong direction, investigate.</p>

          <h3>5. Establish a Fix Process</h3>

          <p>When problems are found, what happens? Define a simple process:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Triage:</strong> Is this urgent (breaking operations) or routine (gradual degradation)?</li>
            <li><strong>Assign:</strong> Who fixes it? (Usually the data owner, but might need others for complex issues)</li>
            <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Resolve the issue</li>
            <li><strong>Prevent:</strong> Can we add validation or a check to prevent recurrence?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Keep it lightweight. The goal is handling issues systematically, not creating bureaucracy.</p>

          <h2>Time Investment</h2>

          <p>Realistic time commitment for this model:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial setup:</strong> 4-8 hours (define standards, set up validation, build metrics dashboard)</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> 30 minutes (check for urgent issues, review import requests)</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> 2-3 hours (metrics review, duplicate detection run, minor cleanup)</li>
            <li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> 4-6 hours (deeper audit, process review, larger cleanup if needed)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>That's roughly 5-10 hours per month total, which is manageable for most ops roles.</p>

          <h2>What to Automate</h2>

          <p>The less manual work, the more sustainable the process. Automate where possible:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Email validation:</strong> Tools like ZeroBounce, NeverBounce, or built-in HubSpot verification can validate automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Duplicate alerts:</strong> Set up alerts when potential duplicates are created</li>
            <li><strong>Data quality reports:</strong> Scheduled reports on key metrics delivered weekly/monthly</li>
            <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Automation to normalize job titles, company names, or other fields on record creation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Every task you automate is a task that gets done consistently without human effort.</p>

          <h2>What to Outsource</h2>

          <p>Some tasks are better outsourced even if you could do them internally:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Large-scale cleanup:</strong> If you have years of accumulated bad data, a one-time cleanup project is often faster and cheaper to outsource than DIY</li>
            <li><strong>Complex deduplication:</strong> Merging thousands of duplicates with complex matching logic is specialized work</li>
            <li><strong>Data enrichment:</strong> Adding missing firmographic data at scale requires data sources you probably don't have</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing validation at scale:</strong> If you have 100K+ contacts, ongoing email verification might be more cost-effective through a service</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The decision criteria: Is this a core competency? Is the time investment worth it vs. the cost of outsourcing? Can we maintain quality if we DIY?</p>

          <h2>Governance for Different Company Stages</h2>

          <h3>Early Stage (Under 10K contacts)</h3>

          <p>Keep it simple:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One person owns data quality (probably founder or first ops hire)</li>
            <li>Validation on web forms</li>
            <li>Review all imports manually</li>
            <li>Monthly sanity check on database</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Don't over-engineer. At this stage, you can fix most problems manually in an hour.</p>

          <h3>Growth Stage (10K-100K contacts)</h3>

          <p>This is where governance starts mattering:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Formal (if lightweight) standards documented</li>
            <li>Automated validation on key entry points</li>
            <li>Monthly metrics tracking</li>
            <li>Quarterly cleanup cycles</li>
            <li>Consider outsourcing the initial cleanup if accumulated debt is significant</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Scale Stage (100K+ contacts)</h3>

          <p>More rigor needed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dedicated part-time or full-time ownership</li>
            <li>Formal data quality SLAs (e.g., email validity above 90%)</li>
            <li>Automated monitoring and alerts</li>
            <li>Regular audits with documented findings</li>
            <li>Budget for ongoing data services (validation, enrichment)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Common Governance Failures</h2>

          <p>Things that don't work:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Governance by committee:</strong> If everyone owns data quality, no one does. Assign one accountable person (the <a href="https://www.dataversity.net/what-is-a-data-steward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data steward model</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation without enforcement:</strong> Writing standards nobody follows is worse than having no standards. Keep what you can actually enforce.</li>
            <li><strong>Big bang cleanup without maintenance:</strong> Spending $50K to clean your database then letting it decay again within a year. Build maintenance into the plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Relying on users:</strong> Expecting sales reps or marketers to maintain data quality voluntarily doesn't work. Build quality into systems, not individual behavior.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Getting Started</h2>

          <p>If you're starting from nothing, here's your first month:</p>

          <p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Assign ownership. Decide who's accountable. Give them authority to make changes.</p>

          <p><strong>Week 2:</strong> Audit current state. Run duplicate detection, check email validity on a sample, measure field completion for key fields. Know what you're dealing with.</p>

          <p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Add basic validation. At minimum: email format validation on forms, import review process, required fields in CRM.</p>

          <p><strong>Week 4:</strong> Set up monitoring. Build a simple dashboard with your key metrics. Schedule monthly review.</p>

          <p>From there, iterate. Add validation where you find problems. Automate what you can. Outsource what makes sense. The goal isn't perfection. It's continuous improvement with sustainable effort.</p>
