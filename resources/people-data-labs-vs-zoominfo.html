      <div class="blog-content">

        <p>People Data Labs (PDL) and ZoomInfo get compared often, but they're fundamentally different products serving different buyers. ZoomInfo is a full sales intelligence platform. PDL is a data API. Comparing them head-to-head is like comparing Salesforce to a database: one is a product, the other is an ingredient.</p>

        <p>That said, both companies sell B2B contact and company data used for enrichment, and if you're evaluating data providers for your CRM, you need to understand what each offers and where the tradeoffs are.</p>

        <h2>Company Overview: Revenue & Scale</h2>

        <p>Understanding the size of each company matters because it directly correlates with database investment, data freshness, and long-term viability.</p>

        <p><strong>ZoomInfo (NASDAQ: ZI)</strong> is publicly traded with approximately $1.2 billion in annual revenue (FY 2024). They employ roughly 3,500 people and have been acquiring companies aggressively (Chorus.ai, Engage, RingLead) to build a full sales intelligence suite. They're the market leader in B2B contact data by a wide margin.</p>

        <p><strong>People Data Labs</strong> is privately held, backed by ~$30 million in funding. Estimated annual revenue is in the $30-60 million range based on team size (~100 employees), funding stage, and market position. They've focused on being the best data API rather than building a full platform.</p>

        <p>The revenue gap tells you something important: ZoomInfo invests significantly more in data collection, human verification, and database freshness. PDL competes on breadth, API developer experience, and pricing flexibility.</p>

        <h2>Database Size & Coverage</h2>

        <table class="comparison-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Metric</th>
              <th>People Data Labs</th>
              <th>ZoomInfo</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Person records</td>
              <td>1.5+ billion</td>
              <td>260+ million B2B</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Company records</td>
              <td>100+ million</td>
              <td>100+ million</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Email addresses</td>
              <td>Billions (many personal)</td>
              <td>Focused on B2B work emails</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Phone numbers</td>
              <td>Available, not primary focus</td>
              <td>Direct dials + mobile, some verified</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Data sources</td>
              <td>Aggregated from public web, social, business registries</td>
              <td>Proprietary collection + web + community-contributed</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>PDL's number looks bigger because it includes consumer data, personal emails, and international records that many B2B buyers don't need. ZoomInfo's 260 million is focused on business professionals with work emails and company associations. For B2B enrichment, the relevant comparison is tighter than the raw numbers suggest.</p>

        <h3>Data Quality vs. Data Quantity</h3>

        <p>PDL's approach is aggregation: pull from as many sources as possible, link records together with identity resolution, and provide the combined dataset via API. The breadth is impressive, but accuracy on any individual record varies. You're getting probabilistic data, not verified data.</p>

        <p>ZoomInfo invests in human verification for their most important records (typically enterprise contacts and high-value titles). They also collect data through their contributor network: companies that install ZoomInfo integrations share anonymized email signature and organizational data. This gives ZoomInfo a data moat that's hard to replicate.</p>

        <p>For practical purposes: if you're enriching enterprise contacts at Fortune 5000 companies, ZoomInfo's per-record accuracy is generally higher. If you're enriching a broad dataset that includes international records, small businesses, or consumer-adjacent data (like B2B2C), PDL's coverage breadth can fill gaps that ZoomInfo misses.</p>

        <h2>Product Model: API vs. Platform</h2>

        <p>This is the fundamental difference and it determines which one is right for your team.</p>

        <h3>People Data Labs: API-First</h3>

        <p>PDL sells raw data access through a REST API. You write code (or use a tool that integrates with their API) to query their database. There's no dashboard, no prospecting UI, no intent data, no CRM integration out of the box. You get the data and build whatever you want with it.</p>

        <p>This makes PDL the choice for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Engineering teams building enrichment into their own products</li>
          <li>Data teams that want raw data for analysis and modeling</li>
          <li>Companies using orchestration tools like Clay that can call PDL's API</li>
          <li>Anyone who needs flexible, programmatic access to person and company data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ZoomInfo: Full Platform</h3>

        <p>ZoomInfo is a complete sales intelligence suite. You get a web application with search, prospecting, intent signals, buyer engagement, workflow automation, and native CRM integrations. Sales reps can use it without writing a line of code.</p>

        <p>This makes ZoomInfo the choice for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sales teams that need a turnkey prospecting tool</li>
          <li>Revenue operations teams that want CRM enrichment with a GUI</li>
          <li>Companies that want intent data alongside contact data</li>
          <li>Organizations without engineering resources to build custom integrations</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-box">
          <p><strong>The key question:</strong> Do you have engineers who can integrate an API, or do you need a platform your sales team can log into? If the former, PDL is worth evaluating. If the latter, ZoomInfo (or a similar platform) is what you need.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>

        <p><strong>People Data Labs</strong> offers usage-based pricing. You pay per API call or per record returned. Pricing tiers start around $0.01-0.05 per enrichment depending on volume commitment. No per-seat fees. Self-serve signup available for smaller volumes. Enterprise contracts negotiable for high volume.</p>

        <p><strong>ZoomInfo</strong> charges annual platform fees starting around $15,000-30,000 per year for a small team. Pricing is per-seat plus data credits. Contracts are annual with auto-renewal. No self-serve option; you have to go through their sales process.</p>

        <p>For a company enriching 10,000 records per month, the math looks roughly like:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>PDL:</strong> $1,200-6,000/year depending on per-record rate and volume tier</li>
          <li><strong>ZoomInfo:</strong> $15,000-30,000/year minimum</li>
        </ul>

        <p>PDL is dramatically cheaper at the per-record level, but you're paying for raw data without a platform. The total cost of ownership includes engineering time to build and maintain the integration. For teams with existing technical infrastructure, this math usually favors PDL. For teams buying their first data tool, ZoomInfo's all-in-one approach may be worth the premium.</p>

        <h2>When to Use Each</h2>

        <h3>Choose People Data Labs When:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>You have engineering resources to build API integrations</li>
          <li>You're building enrichment into your own product</li>
          <li>You need high-volume enrichment at low per-record cost</li>
          <li>You're using a data orchestration tool (Clay, etc.) that supports PDL</li>
          <li>You want to combine multiple data sources in a waterfall</li>
          <li>Your budget doesn't support a $15K+ annual platform</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Choose ZoomInfo When:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Your sales team needs a prospecting interface</li>
          <li>You want native CRM enrichment without custom code</li>
          <li>You need intent data alongside contact data</li>
          <li>Enterprise-grade data accuracy is critical</li>
          <li>You don't have engineering bandwidth for API integrations</li>
          <li>You want a single vendor for data + engagement + intelligence</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Use Both Together When:</h3>

        <p>A common pattern is using ZoomInfo as the primary enrichment source and PDL as a fallback for records ZoomInfo doesn't cover. Run ZoomInfo first (higher per-record accuracy), then pass non-matches to PDL (broader coverage, lower cost). This maximizes fill rate while keeping costs manageable.</p>

        <h2>The Alternative: Done-For-You Enrichment</h2>

        <p>Both PDL and ZoomInfo are self-serve. You still need someone to manage the enrichment process, handle data quality, and sync results to your CRM. If you'd rather hand off the entire workflow, a managed enrichment service handles all of it: sourcing from multiple providers, validating results, deduplicating records, and writing clean data back to Salesforce or HubSpot.</p>

        <p>We do this at Verum. Per-record pricing, no annual contract, and we handle the data quality work that platform tools leave to you.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What is the estimated revenue of People Data Labs vs ZoomInfo?</h3>
          <p>ZoomInfo is publicly traded with ~$1.2 billion in annual revenue. People Data Labs is private with estimated revenue of $30-60 million. ZoomInfo is roughly 20-40x larger, reflecting its broader platform and enterprise sales motion.</p>

          <h3>Is People Data Labs more accurate than ZoomInfo?</h3>
          <p>It depends on the segment. ZoomInfo typically has better per-record accuracy for large US companies due to human verification investment. PDL has broader coverage across international markets and smaller companies. For email deliverability, both achieve 85-95% on their best data, with accuracy declining for older records and smaller companies.</p>

          <h3>Can I use People Data Labs and ZoomInfo together?</h3>
          <p>Yes. A data waterfall strategy (ZoomInfo first, PDL as fallback) maximizes coverage while managing cost. Tools like Clay make it easy to build multi-provider enrichment sequences.</p>

          <h3>What's the main difference between PDL and ZoomInfo?</h3>
          <p>PDL is an API-first data provider (raw data access for developers). ZoomInfo is a full sales intelligence platform (prospecting UI, intent data, CRM integrations). PDL is for technical teams building custom enrichment. ZoomInfo is for sales teams who want a turnkey solution.</p>
