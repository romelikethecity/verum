          <h1>CRM Data Quality for Sales Leaders: What You Need to Know</h1>

          <p>Your best rep just spent 45 minutes researching a prospect. Found their LinkedIn, figured out they'd changed companies, tracked down the new email, updated the CRM. Then discovered another rep had already been working that account under a different record.</p>

          <p>This happens more than anyone wants to admit. And it's not a training problem or a motivation problem. It's a data problem that's costing you pipeline every single day.</p>

          <h2>The Hidden Tax on Your Sales Team</h2>

          <p>Most sales leaders know their data isn't perfect. What they underestimate is how much it's actually costing them.</p>

          <p>According to <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce's State of Sales report</a>, the average sales rep spends 20-30% of their time on data-related tasks. Finding correct contact information. Researching whether a prospect is still at the company. Updating records. Figuring out if someone else is already working an account.</p>

          <p>For a team of 10 reps, that's 2-3 full-time equivalents worth of selling time. Every year. Not selling. Just dealing with data.</p>

          <p>And that's just the visible cost. The invisible costs are worse:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Leads routed to the wrong rep because company size was missing</li>
            <li>Enterprise deals treated like SMB because revenue data was outdated</li>
            <li>Hot prospects ignored because their email bounced and nobody followed up</li>
            <li>Duplicate outreach that makes your team look uncoordinated</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You can't inspect your way out of this. You can't coach your way out of it either. The data itself needs to be fixed.</p>

          <h2>What Bad Data Looks Like in the CRM</h2>

          <p>Here's what's probably sitting in your CRM right now:</p>

          <h3>Duplicate Records</h3>

          <p>The same person exists as three different contacts. The same company exists under four different names. Your reps don't know this, so two of them are working the same account. One sends a cold email while the other is scheduling a demo. The prospect thinks you're disorganized. They're right.</p>

          <h3>Outdated Contacts</h3>

          <p>According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/tenure.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the median employee tenure is around 4 years—meaning contacts go stale quickly. Your database has contacts from five years ago. Half of them don't work at those companies anymore. Your reps are emailing into the void, tanking your deliverability, and wondering why response rates are down.</p>

          <h3>Missing Information</h3>

          <p>You need company size to route leads correctly. 40% of your accounts don't have it. You need direct phone numbers for outbound. 60% of your contacts only have the main company line. You need industry to prioritize. Half your records say "Other" or nothing at all.</p>

          <h3>Incorrect Data</h3>

          <p>The company shows 50 employees. They actually have 500. Your routing sent them to the SMB team. By the time anyone realizes the mistake, the prospect has already talked to your competitor.</p>

          <h2>Why This Keeps Happening</h2>

          <p>Data doesn't stay accurate. It decays. This aligns with <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/tenure.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> data showing median employee tenure of about 4 years—meaning 25-30% of B2B contact data goes bad every year. People change jobs, companies get acquired, phone numbers change, emails stop working.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, new data is constantly flowing in from multiple sources: marketing forms, trade shows, purchased lists, manual entry. Each source has different quality standards. Some have no standards at all.</p>

          <p>And nobody owns it. Marketing thinks it's a sales ops problem. Sales ops thinks it's an IT problem. IT thinks it's a marketing problem. So nobody fixes it, and it compounds.</p>

          <h2>What You Can Actually Do About It</h2>

          <h3>Stop Expecting Reps to Fix Data</h3>

          <p>Your reps should not be spending their time cleaning data. Their job is to sell. Yes, they should keep their active accounts updated. But asking them to dedupe the database or enrich thousands of records isn't realistic. They won't do it, and you shouldn't want them to.</p>

          <p>Data cleanup needs to be systematic, not ad-hoc. Either your ops team needs dedicated time for it, or you need to outsource it.</p>

          <h3>Know What's Actually Wrong</h3>

          <p>Before you can fix the data, you need to know what's broken. Run an audit:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What percentage of contacts have valid emails?</li>
            <li>What percentage of accounts have company size populated?</li>
            <li>How many duplicate records exist?</li>
            <li>What percentage of contacts have direct phone numbers?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Most leaders are surprised by the results. You can't prioritize fixes if you don't know what's broken.</p>

          <h3>Focus on Active Pipeline First</h3>

          <p>You don't need to clean your entire database at once. Start with what matters most: accounts with open opportunities, accounts your reps are actively working, and your target account list.</p>

          <p>Clean those first. Get immediate value. Then work backward through the rest of the database.</p>

          <h3>Fix the Inflow, Not Just the Stock</h3>

          <p>Cleaning existing data is necessary but not sufficient. If bad data keeps flowing in, you're bailing water with a hole in the boat.</p>

          <p>Look at where data enters your CRM. Web forms, list imports, manual entry, integrations. Add validation where you can. Require certain fields. Clean data on the way in, not just after it's been sitting there for a year.</p>

          <h3>Make Data Quality Visible</h3>

          <p>What gets measured gets managed. Create a simple dashboard that shows data quality metrics: email validity rate, field completion rates, duplicate percentage. Review it monthly. Make it visible to the team.</p>

          <p>When reps see that 40% of their territory has invalid emails, they understand why their outbound isn't working. When they see the duplicate count dropping, they know someone is actually fixing things.</p>

          <h2>The ROI Conversation</h2>

          <p>Data cleanup isn't cheap, whether you do it internally or outsource it. But the math usually works.</p>

          <p>If your reps are spending 25% of their time on data tasks, and you have 10 reps at $100K average OTE, that's $250K in selling capacity lost to data problems. If you could get even half of that back, the investment in data cleanup pays for itself multiple times over.</p>

          <p>That's before you factor in the deals lost to bad routing, the pipeline that evaporated because of bad emails, or the enterprise accounts that got treated like SMB.</p>

          <h2>What to Ask Your Ops Team</h2>

          <p>If you're not sure where your data stands, start with these questions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What percentage of our contacts have valid, verified email addresses?</li>
            <li>How many duplicate account and contact records do we have?</li>
            <li>What's our field completion rate for company size, industry, and phone numbers?</li>
            <li>When was the last time we systematically cleaned the database?</li>
            <li>What happens to data quality after records are created?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If your ops team doesn't know the answers, that tells you something. And if the answers are bad, at least you know what you're dealing with.</p>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>Bad data is a sales problem, not just an ops problem. It directly impacts quota attainment, rep productivity, and pipeline velocity. And unlike most sales problems, it's fixable. Not with training or coaching, but with systematic cleanup and ongoing maintenance.</p>

          <p>Your reps shouldn't be data janitors. But someone needs to take ownership of data quality, and sales leadership needs to care enough to make it happen.</p>
