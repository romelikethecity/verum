        <h1>How to Enrich Salesforce Records Without ZoomInfo</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">January 2026 · 10 min read</p>

        <p>Your Salesforce accounts are missing revenue, employee count, and industry. Your contacts have job titles but no seniority levels. Half your leads don't even have company names filled in.</p>

        <p>The obvious answer is ZoomInfo. The problem is ZoomInfo costs $30,000+ per year. For a lot of companies, that's not in the budget, especially if you're not sure what the ROI looks like.</p>

        <p>Good news: there are other ways to get this data. Some are cheaper. Some are free. Some require more work. Here's what actually works.</p>

        <h2>What Data Should You Actually Enrich?</h2>

        <p>Before you start researching tools, figure out what data you actually need. Enrichment for the sake of enrichment is a waste of money.</p>

        <p>The fields that matter most are the ones that affect:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lead routing:</strong> Which rep handles this? (Usually based on company size, industry, or location)</li>
          <li><strong>Lead scoring:</strong> Is this a good fit? (Based on ICP criteria like revenue, employee count, technology stack)</li>
          <li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> What campaigns should they receive? (Industry, company stage, use case)</li>
          <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> How do we tailor outreach? (Title, seniority, department)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Account-Level Fields (Priority)</h3>

        <p>These are the fields that define whether a company is a fit:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Employee count:</strong> Company size is one of the strongest ICP filters</li>
          <li><strong>Annual revenue:</strong> Indicates budget capacity</li>
          <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Determines messaging, use cases, and sometimes disqualification</li>
          <li><strong>Location (HQ):</strong> Territory assignment, timezone, regulatory considerations</li>
          <li><strong>Technology stack:</strong> What tools do they use? Critical for selling integrations or replacements</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Contact-Level Fields (Secondary)</h3>

        <p>These help with personalization and multi-threading:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Job title (standardized):</strong> "VP Sales" vs "Vice President of Sales" should match your filters</li>
          <li><strong>Seniority level:</strong> C-level, VP, Director, Manager, Individual Contributor</li>
          <li><strong>Department:</strong> Sales, Marketing, Operations, IT, Finance</li>
          <li><strong>Direct phone:</strong> Useful for outbound, but accuracy is inconsistent</li>
          <li><strong>LinkedIn URL:</strong> For research and social selling</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="stat-box">
          <p><strong>Focus first on account data.</strong> If you know the company fits your ICP, you can always research individual contacts later. The reverse doesn't work as well.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>ZoomInfo Alternatives by Budget</h2>

        <p>Here's how the options break down, from free to expensive:</p>

        <h3>Free: Manual Research + LinkedIn</h3>

        <p>Time-intensive but works for small volumes. Your SDRs are probably already doing this for outbound research.</p>

        <p>What you can find:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Company size (LinkedIn company page, About Us)</li>
          <li>Industry (LinkedIn, company website)</li>
          <li>Funding stage (Crunchbase, LinkedIn news)</li>
          <li>Technology stack (BuiltWith, Wappalyzer for websites)</li>
          <li>Contact titles and seniority (LinkedIn)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Limitations: Doesn't scale. No way to bulk-enrich 10,000 records. Revenue data is often unavailable for private companies.</p>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Startups with small databases, high-value target accounts worth manual research.</p>

        <h3>Low Cost ($1-5K/year): Point Solutions</h3>

        <p>Several tools specialize in specific types of enrichment data:</p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Tool</th>
              <th>Best For</th>
              <th>Pricing Model</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Clearbit</strong></td>
              <td>Company data, tech stack</td>
              <td>Credits-based</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Apollo.io</strong></td>
              <td>Contact data, emails, phones</td>
              <td>Subscription + credits</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Hunter.io</strong></td>
              <td>Email finding and verification</td>
              <td>Per-email credits</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>BuiltWith</strong></td>
              <td>Technology stack data</td>
              <td>Subscription</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Lusha</strong></td>
              <td>Contact direct dials</td>
              <td>Credits-based</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>People Data Labs</strong></td>
              <td>Bulk person/company data API</td>
              <td>Per-record pricing</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The advantage of point solutions is you only pay for what you need. If you just need company employee counts, you don't have to buy a full contact database.</p>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Companies with specific data gaps (like missing employee count on all accounts) rather than comprehensive enrichment needs.</p>

        <h3>Mid-Range ($5-15K/year): Full-Featured Alternatives</h3>

        <p>These platforms compete directly with ZoomInfo at lower price points:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apollo.io (higher tiers):</strong> Full contact and company database with decent accuracy. Native Salesforce integration.</li>
          <li><strong>Cognism:</strong> Strong in EMEA data. GDPR-compliant. Good for international sales teams.</li>
          <li><strong>LeadIQ:</strong> Chrome extension focus. Good for prospecting workflows.</li>
          <li><strong>Seamless.ai:</strong> Real-time email and phone finding. Variable data quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Accuracy varies. None of these match ZoomInfo's database size, but for many use cases, 80% accuracy at 50% of the cost is a good tradeoff.</p>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Mid-market companies with active outbound programs and 10,000-100,000 records to enrich.</p>

        <h3>Enterprise ($30K+/year): ZoomInfo and Competitors</h3>

        <p>If budget isn't the constraint, these are the most comprehensive options:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>ZoomInfo:</strong> Largest database, best accuracy, widest feature set. The default choice if you can afford it.</li>
          <li><strong>6sense:</strong> Account-based platform with intent data. More expensive but includes buying signals.</li>
          <li><strong>Demandbase:</strong> Similar to 6sense. Strong ABM features alongside data.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Enterprise companies where data accuracy directly impacts revenue and the cost is justified by pipeline value.</p>

        <h2>Building an Enrichment Workflow</h2>

        <p>Whatever tools you choose, you need a process. Here's how to set up enrichment that actually works.</p>

        <h3>Point-of-Entry Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Enrich new records as they come in. This is the most valuable place to invest because clean data from the start prevents problems downstream.</p>

        <p>For web form submissions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Capture company email domain</li>
          <li>Call enrichment API (Clearbit, Apollo, etc.)</li>
          <li>Auto-populate company fields (employee count, industry, revenue)</li>
          <li>Pass enriched lead to Salesforce</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Most enrichment tools have native integrations with form platforms (Marketo, HubSpot) or Salesforce that handle this automatically.</p>

        <h3>Batch Enrichment for Existing Records</h3>

        <p>For records already in Salesforce, you'll need to export, enrich, and reimport.</p>

        <p>Process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Export records with Salesforce ID, company name, domain, and existing data</li>
          <li>Upload to your enrichment tool or use their API</li>
          <li>Review enriched data for obvious errors</li>
          <li>Import back to Salesforce, matching on ID</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Important: Don't overwrite existing good data with enriched data that might be less accurate. Create logic that only fills blank fields or updates fields where the existing value is clearly outdated.</p>

        <h3>Scheduled Re-Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Company data changes. People get promoted, companies grow, and acquisitions happen. Set up quarterly or semi-annual re-enrichment for your active accounts.</p>

        <p>Prioritize:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open opportunities (data accuracy matters most here)</li>
          <li>Target accounts (your ABM list)</li>
          <li>Recently engaged accounts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Don't re-enrich your entire database every quarter. That's expensive and usually unnecessary for dormant records.</p>

        <h2>DIY Enrichment with Multiple Sources</h2>

        <p>You can build a reasonable enrichment stack by combining free and low-cost sources. It requires more work but can save significant money.</p>

        <h3>Company Data Stack</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Company website:</strong> About page usually lists employee count ranges, locations, and sometimes revenue</li>
          <li><strong>LinkedIn company page:</strong> Employee count, industry, headquarters, recent hires</li>
          <li><strong>Crunchbase:</strong> Funding data, estimated revenue for tech companies, key people</li>
          <li><strong>BuiltWith/Wappalyzer:</strong> Technology stack from website analysis (free tiers available)</li>
          <li><strong>SEC filings:</strong> Revenue, employee count for public companies (free, accurate)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Contact Data Stack</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>LinkedIn Sales Navigator:</strong> Job titles, seniority, recent job changes</li>
          <li><strong>Hunter.io:</strong> Email pattern discovery and verification</li>
          <li><strong>Email permutator tools:</strong> Generate likely email formats and verify</li>
          <li><strong>Company website:</strong> Leadership pages, press releases for executive info</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Automation Options</h3>

        <p>Tools like Clay, Bardeen, or custom scripts can automate pulling from multiple sources. You can build a workflow that:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Takes a company domain as input</li>
          <li>Pulls LinkedIn company data</li>
          <li>Checks Crunchbase for funding</li>
          <li>Runs BuiltWith for tech stack</li>
          <li>Combines results into a single enriched record</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This requires technical setup but can match the output of paid enrichment tools at a fraction of the cost.</p>

        <h2>Common Enrichment Mistakes</h2>

        <p><strong>Enriching everything at once.</strong> Start with your most valuable segments (target accounts, active opportunities) and expand from there. Enriching 100,000 records you'll never use is a waste.</p>

        <p><strong>Trusting enriched data blindly.</strong> No enrichment source is 100% accurate. Validate critical data before high-stakes actions like enterprise outreach.</p>

        <p><strong>Overwriting good data.</strong> If a field already has a value, don't automatically replace it with enriched data. The existing value might be from direct customer input or verified by your team.</p>

        <p><strong>Ignoring data decay.</strong> Enriched data has a shelf life. That employee count from 18 months ago is probably wrong now, especially for fast-growing companies.</p>

        <p><strong>Not tracking data sources.</strong> Create a field for "data source" or "enrichment date" so you know where values came from and when they were last updated.</p>

        <h2>Measuring Enrichment ROI</h2>

        <p>How do you know if enrichment is worth the investment? Track these metrics:</p>

        <p><strong>Field fill rates:</strong> What percentage of records have values for your key fields? Track before and after enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Lead scoring accuracy:</strong> Are enriched leads scoring correctly? Look at conversion rates by score bracket.</p>

        <p><strong>Routing accuracy:</strong> Are leads going to the right reps? Fewer manual reassignments means routing data is working.</p>

        <p><strong>Sales productivity:</strong> How much time are reps spending on manual research? Should decrease with good enrichment.</p>

        <p><strong>Campaign performance:</strong> Are segmented campaigns (based on enriched data) outperforming generic campaigns?</p>

        <h2>When to Outsource Enrichment</h2>

        <p>Sometimes it makes more sense to have someone else handle this. Consider outsourcing if:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>You have a large backlog:</strong> 50,000+ records with missing data is a significant project</li>
          <li><strong>You need custom research:</strong> Data not available from standard enrichment tools (niche industries, specific qualifiers)</li>
          <li><strong>You're migrating CRMs:</strong> <a href="/resources/crm-migration-data-cleanup.html">Clean and enrich before you move</a>, not after</li>
          <li><strong>You lack technical resources:</strong> Building and maintaining enrichment workflows takes time</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At Verum, <a href="/enrichment/">data enrichment</a> is one of our core services. We use a combination of data sources and custom research to fill gaps that automated tools miss. For companies without dedicated RevOps resources, it's often more cost-effective than building internal capabilities.</p>
