  <section class="content">
    <div class="container" style="max-width: 700px;">

      <div class="blog-meta">January 2026 &middot; 10 min read</div>

      <div class="blog-content">

        <p>Your sales team pulls up an account. The company record shows one contact. But you know there are five people there who've filled out forms, attended webinars, and requested demos. Where are they?</p>

        <p>Floating in your database without company associations. They exist in HubSpot. They have activity history. But because they're not connected to the company record, they're invisible to anyone looking at the account view.</p>

        <p>Orphaned contacts are one of HubSpot's most common data quality problems. They break <a href="/glossary/abm/">account-based marketing</a>, corrupt company-level reporting, and create blind spots for sales. HubSpot's automatic association tries to prevent this, but it fails more often than most people realize.</p>

        <h2>Why Associations Break</h2>

        <p>HubSpot has <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/automatically-create-and-associate-companies-with-contacts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic contact-to-company association</a>. When it works, contacts get linked to companies based on email domain. When it doesn't, you get orphans.</p>

        <h3>Personal Email Addresses</h3>

        <p>This is the biggest cause. Someone fills out a form with their Gmail address. HubSpot sees the domain (gmail.com) and correctly decides not to associate them with a company called "Gmail" (because that would be wrong). But it also doesn't associate them with anything else.</p>

        <p>If the contact provided a company name in a form field, that data sits in the Company property on the contact record, but there's no actual association to a company object. For account-based purposes, this contact doesn't exist at the company level.</p>

        <h3>Missing Website URL</h3>

        <p>HubSpot's fallback for personal email addresses is the Website URL field on the contact. If that field matches a company's domain, association happens. But that field is rarely populated unless you explicitly ask for it on forms.</p>

        <p>No work email + no website URL = orphaned contact.</p>

        <h3>Domain Mismatches</h3>

        <p>A contact has an email at subsidiary.parentcompany.com. Your company record has the website domain parentcompany.com. No match. The contact is orphaned, even though they clearly belong to that company.</p>

        <p>This also happens with:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Companies that have changed domains</li>
          <li>Companies with regional domains (acme.co.uk vs acme.com)</li>
          <li>Companies with multiple business units on different domains</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Imports Without Association Data</h3>

        <p>You import a list from an event. The CSV has contact names and emails but no company association data. HubSpot creates the contacts, tries auto-association, fails for anyone with a personal email, and you have a batch of orphans.</p>

        <h3>Integrations That Create Without Associating</h3>

        <p>Third-party tools (chat widgets, scheduling apps, <a href="/glossary/data-enrichment/">data enrichment</a> tools) often create contacts in HubSpot. Some do association well. Many don't. They create the contact but don't include the company association, leaving it to HubSpot's auto-association to (often fail to) figure out.</p>

        <h2>Finding Orphaned Contacts</h2>

        <p>First, understand the scope of the problem.</p>

        <h3>Basic Orphan List</h3>

        <p>Create an <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/lists/create-active-or-static-lists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active list</a> with the criteria: Associated Company is unknown.</p>

        <p>This shows every contact with no company association. The number might surprise you. In databases that have been running for years without association hygiene, 20-40% of contacts being orphaned is common.</p>

        <h3>Prioritized Orphan Lists</h3>

        <p>Not all orphans are equally important. Create segmented lists:</p>

        <p><strong>High-value orphans:</strong> Associated Company is unknown AND (Lifecycle stage is MQL OR Lifecycle stage is SQL OR Lifecycle stage is Opportunity). These are active pipeline contacts that sales should see at the account level.</p>

        <p><strong>Recently created orphans:</strong> Associated Company is unknown AND Create date is less than 30 days ago. These are new contacts that should be fixed before they accumulate activity that's invisible at the account level.</p>

        <p><strong>Orphans with company data:</strong> Associated Company is unknown AND Company is known. These contacts have a company name in a field but no actual association. They're fixable if you can match the company name to an existing company record.</p>

        <h3>Calculate Your Orphan Rate</h3>

        <p>Total contacts with no company association / Total contacts = Orphan rate.</p>

        <p>Under 10% is manageable with ongoing maintenance. 10-25% suggests you need process changes. Over 25% means associations are fundamentally broken in your data entry and import processes.</p>

        <h2>Fixing Associations</h2>

        <p>The approach depends on how many orphans you have and what data you have to work with.</p>

        <h3>Manual Association (Small Scale)</h3>

        <p>For individual high-priority contacts (see <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/associate-records" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot's guide on associating records</a>):</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Go to the contact record</li>
          <li>In the Companies panel, click "Add"</li>
          <li>Search for the company</li>
          <li>Select and save</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This works for a few dozen contacts but doesn't scale.</p>

        <h3>Import-Based Bulk Association</h3>

        <p>For larger volumes where you know which company each contact should associate with (see <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/import-associations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot's import associations guide</a>):</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Export your orphaned contacts with Record ID</li>
          <li>Add a column for "Associated Company ID" (the record ID of the company)</li>
          <li>Fill in the company IDs (you'll need to look these up or match programmatically)</li>
          <li>Import the file, mapping the association column to create associations</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This requires you to know or determine the correct company for each contact. If you have a "Company" text field populated, you can try to match it against existing company names to get the IDs.</p>

        <h3>Domain-Based Bulk Association</h3>

        <p>If your orphans have work email addresses that didn't auto-associate (because of domain mismatches or configuration issues):</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Export orphans with email addresses</li>
          <li>Extract the email domains</li>
          <li>Match domains against company website domains in HubSpot</li>
          <li>For matches, use the import method above to create associations</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This handles cases where auto-association should have worked but didn't.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Tools</h3>

        <p>For serious bulk association, tools like Insycle offer more sophisticated matching:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Match contacts to companies based on multiple fields (email domain, company name, etc.)</li>
          <li><a href="/glossary/fuzzy-matching/">Fuzzy matching</a> for company name variations</li>
          <li>Scheduled automated association for ongoing maintenance</li>
          <li>Preview before committing changes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The investment is worth it if you have thousands of orphans and this is a recurring problem.</p>

        <h2>Handling Personal Email Contacts</h2>

        <p>The hardest orphans to fix are contacts with personal email addresses. You can't domain-match them because their domain is Gmail, not their employer.</p>

        <h3>Use the Company Name Field</h3>

        <p>If your forms collect company name, that data exists on the contact record. You can try to match it against existing company records:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Export orphans where Company (text field) is known</li>
          <li>Export your company records with Company Name and Record ID</li>
          <li>Match contact company names to company record names</li>
          <li>For matches, import to create associations</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The challenge is fuzzy matching. "Acme" might need to match "Acme Inc." or "Acme Corporation." This requires some data wrangling or a tool that handles variations.</p>

        <h3>Data Enrichment</h3>

        <p>Enrichment services can identify a contact's employer from their name and personal email (via LinkedIn data, public records, etc.). Once you have verified company information, you can create associations.</p>

        <p>This costs money and has varying match rates, but it's the only reliable way to associate contacts who gave you zero company information.</p>

        <h3>Manual Research</h3>

        <p>For high-value contacts (active opportunities, target accounts), manual LinkedIn lookups can identify the company. This doesn't scale, but for the 50 contacts that matter most, it might be worth the time.</p>

        <h3>Accept Some Orphans</h3>

        <p>Not every contact needs a company association. Individual consumers (if you do any B2C), personal contacts of employees, and low-value leads might not be worth the effort to associate. Focus resources on contacts that matter for your account-based motions.</p>

        <h2>Preventing Future Orphans</h2>

        <p>Cleanup is wasted if the problem keeps recurring.</p>

        <h3>Configure Auto-Association Properly</h3>

        <p>Make sure HubSpot's <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/automatically-create-and-associate-companies-with-contacts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic contact-to-company association</a> is enabled: Settings > Objects > Companies > "Create and associate companies with contacts."</p>

        <p>Understand what this does: it associates contacts based on email domain and can create company records if no match exists. This prevents orphans but can create duplicate companies if you already have a company under a different domain.</p>

        <h3>Form Design</h3>

        <p>Collect data that enables association:</p>

        <p><strong>Ask for work email:</strong> Label the email field "Work Email" to encourage business addresses over personal ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Ask for company website:</strong> If someone uses a personal email, website URL is the fallback for auto-association.</p>

        <p><strong>Make company name required:</strong> Even if you can't auto-associate, having the company name makes manual or bulk association possible later.</p>

        <h3>Import Practices</h3>

        <p>When importing contacts:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Include company association data if you have it</li>
          <li>Validate that company records exist before importing contact associations</li>
          <li>After import, check the orphan count and address new orphans promptly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ongoing Monitoring</h3>

        <p>Track your orphan rate over time. If it's climbing, something in your data entry process is broken. Create a recurring task to review orphans monthly and address them before they accumulate.</p>

        <h2>The Hidden Costs</h2>

        <p>Why does this matter enough to fix?</p>

        <p><strong>Sales blind spots.</strong> A rep looking at an account sees one contact. They don't know three other people from that company have engaged with marketing. They reach out cold when they should reach out warm. Or they don't reach out at all because the account looks inactive.</p>

        <p><strong>Broken ABM.</strong> Account-based campaigns rely on understanding account-level engagement. If half the contacts from your target accounts are orphaned, your account scores are wrong. Your engagement metrics are wrong. Your targeting is wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>Incomplete reporting.</strong> Reports on company engagement, contacts per account, deal velocity by company characteristics, all skewed by orphaned contacts that don't roll up properly.</p>

        <p><strong>Automation failures.</strong> Workflows that trigger based on company properties won't fire for orphaned contacts. A "notify sales when target account engages" workflow misses every orphan.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why doesn't HubSpot associate all contacts automatically?</h3>
          <p>HubSpot's auto-association uses email domain matching. Personal emails don't match business domains. Contacts without email or with domain mismatches won't associate. The system errs on the side of not creating wrong associations, which means some correct associations don't happen.</p>

          <h3>Can auto-association create duplicate companies?</h3>
          <p>Yes. If a contact's email domain doesn't match an existing company's website domain, HubSpot may create a new company. This is especially common with subsidiaries, regional domains, or incomplete company data.</p>

          <h3>How do I bulk associate contacts?</h3>
          <p>HubSpot's native tools handle associations one at a time. For bulk operations, export contacts, add company record IDs, reimport with association mapping. Or use a tool like Insycle for matching rules and bulk processing.</p>

          <h3>What about company rollup data?</h3>
          <p>Orphaned contacts don't contribute to company-level metrics. Rollup fields, engagement tracking, and account-based reports all miss their activity. Companies with mostly orphaned contacts look dead even when people are engaging.</p>
