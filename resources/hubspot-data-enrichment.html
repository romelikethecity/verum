      <div class="blog-content">

        <p><strong>HubSpot data enrichment</strong> is the process of filling in missing contact and company fields in your HubSpot CRM using external data sources. HubSpot includes native enrichment through Breeze Intelligence (formerly HubSpot Insights), but many companies supplement this with third-party tools or services for deeper coverage of fields like direct dial phone numbers, technology stack, and verified email addresses.</p>

        <p>Your HubSpot database has gaps. Contacts without phone numbers. Companies without employee count. Industries blank. Revenue unknown. The data that would let you segment, score, route, and prioritize just isn't there.</p>

        <p>The obvious solution is a data enrichment platform. ZoomInfo, Cognism, Apollo. But these tools cost $15-50K per year. For a lot of companies, that's not in the budget. Or the budget exists, but you're not sure the ROI is there for your database size and use case.</p>

        <p>This guide covers the enrichment landscape for HubSpot users. What's available at different price points, how to evaluate providers, and how to get the data you need without enterprise-level spend.</p>

        <h2>What Enrichment Actually Gets You</h2>

        <p>Before comparing options, clarify what data you need and why.</p>

        <h3>Contact-Level Data</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Phone numbers:</strong> Direct dials for sales outreach. Mobile vs. office. The difference between reaching someone and reaching voicemail.</li>
          <li><strong>Job title (verified):</strong> What's in your database might be outdated or self-reported incorrectly.</li>
          <li><strong>Seniority/level:</strong> C-level, VP, Director, Manager, Individual Contributor. Critical for routing and targeting.</li>
          <li><strong>Department/function:</strong> Sales, Marketing, IT, Finance, Operations.</li>
          <li><strong>LinkedIn profile:</strong> For sales research and social selling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Company-Level Data (Firmographics)</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Employee count:</strong> For company size segmentation. Ranges like 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Harder to get accurately, but useful for targeting.</li>
          <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Standardized categories for segmentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> Headquarters, but also other office locations.</li>
          <li><strong>Technologies used:</strong> What tools and platforms they run. Useful for tech companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Funding/investors:</strong> For companies selling to startups or VC-backed businesses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Do You Actually Need?</h3>

        <p>Most companies don't need everything. Think about your use cases:</p>

        <p><strong>Lead routing:</strong> Company size, industry, maybe location.</p>

        <p><strong>Lead scoring:</strong> Job title/seniority, company size, industry, maybe tech stack.</p>

        <p><strong>Sales outreach:</strong> Phone numbers, verified job titles, LinkedIn profiles.</p>

        <p><strong>Segmentation:</strong> Industry, company size, job function.</p>

        <p>Clarify your priority data points before evaluating providers. You might not need the most thorough (and expensive) solution.</p>

        <h2>HubSpot's Native Enrichment</h2>

        <p>HubSpot has some enrichment built in. It's limited, but it's included in your subscription.</p>

        <h3>Company Insights</h3>

        <p>When you create a company record and add a domain, HubSpot <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/companies/hubspot-insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto-populates some fields</a>: description, industry, employee count range, social profiles, and more. This data comes from HubSpot's own database plus public sources.</p>

        <p>Coverage varies. Large, well-known companies usually populate well. Smaller companies and those outside the US often don't. Recent startups might have no data at all.</p>

        <h3>Breeze Intelligence</h3>

        <p>HubSpot's <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/data-management/enrich-company-and-contact-records-with-breeze-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breeze Intelligence</a> is an add-on that provides broader enrichment. It enriches both contacts and companies with firmographic and <a href="/glossary/technographic-data/">technographic data</a>.</p>

        <p>Pricing is credit-based, on top of your existing HubSpot subscription. The cost scales with usage. For companies already committed to the HubSpot ecosystem, it's worth evaluating since integration is native.</p>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>

        <p>HubSpot's native options work for basic company data on well-known companies. For contact-level enrichment (phone numbers, verified titles), smaller companies, or full coverage, you'll need third-party tools.</p>

        <h2>The Major Platforms (And Their Costs)</h2>

        <p>The big names in B2B data. These are thorough but expensive.</p>

        <h3>ZoomInfo</h3>

        <p>The market leader. Extensive US B2B coverage. Direct dials, org charts, intent data, technographics. Native HubSpot integration.</p>

        <p>Pricing: Typically $15-30K/year for SMB. Enterprise can be $50K+. Annual contracts. The exact price depends on your use case, seat count, and credit volume.</p>

        <p>Pros: Broadest coverage, deepest data, reliable quality. Cons: Expensive, aggressive sales tactics, annual commitment.</p>

        <h3>Cognism</h3>

        <p>Strong in European data, which ZoomInfo historically struggled with. Good for GDPR-compliant outreach. Phone-verified mobile numbers.</p>

        <p>Pricing: Generally slightly cheaper than ZoomInfo. Annual contracts starting around $15K for SMB.</p>

        <p>Pros: Better international coverage, phone verification, GDPR focus. Cons: Still expensive, US coverage not as deep as ZoomInfo.</p>

        <h3>Apollo.io</h3>

        <p>More affordable than ZoomInfo/Cognism. Good breadth of data. Built-in email sequencing and sales engagement. Free tier available.</p>

        <p>Pricing: Free tier with limited credits. Paid plans from $49/month (Basic) to $99/month (Professional) to enterprise custom pricing. Per-user pricing makes it affordable for small teams but adds up for larger ones.</p>

        <p>Pros: Much cheaper, integrated sales tools, generous free tier. Cons: Data quality somewhat lower than ZoomInfo, phone number coverage can be spotty.</p>

        <h3>Clearbit (now part of HubSpot)</h3>

        <p>Clearbit was acquired by HubSpot in 2023 and is being integrated into the platform as Breeze Intelligence. If you're on HubSpot, this becomes the most native option.</p>

        <p>Pricing: Varies based on HubSpot tier and credit usage. Check current HubSpot pricing for Breeze Intelligence add-ons.</p>

        <p>Pros: Deep HubSpot integration, real-time enrichment, good <a href="/glossary/firmographic-data/">firmographic data</a>. Cons: Contact-level phone data isn't as strong as ZoomInfo.</p>

        <h2>Mid-Range and Budget Options</h2>

        <p>Not everyone needs (or can afford) the big platforms. These options work for smaller budgets.</p>

        <h3>Lusha</h3>

        <p>Contact data focused (emails, direct dials). Browser extension model. Pay-per-contact pricing.</p>

        <p>Pricing: Free tier with limited credits. Paid plans from ~$40/month per user with more credits.</p>

        <p>Pros: Affordable, good for sales teams who need phone numbers. Cons: Less firmographic data, quality can vary.</p>

        <h3>Hunter</h3>

        <p>Email finding and verification. Not a full enrichment platform, but useful for email gaps.</p>

        <p>Pricing: Free tier (25 searches/month). Paid from $49/month for 500 searches.</p>

        <p>Pros: Affordable, good email verification, API available. Cons: Emails only, no phone numbers or firmographics.</p>

        <h3>RocketReach</h3>

        <p>Contact data with email and phone coverage. Less expensive than ZoomInfo.</p>

        <p>Pricing: From $53/month for individuals. Team plans scale up.</p>

        <p>Pros: Decent phone coverage at lower cost. Cons: Data quality varies, interface less polished.</p>

        <h3>LinkedIn Sales Navigator</h3>

        <p>Not enrichment in the traditional sense, but excellent for verified job data and research. You can see current titles, company info, and recent activity. Pairs well with other enrichment tools.</p>

        <p>Pricing: From ~$100/month.</p>

        <p>Pros: Verified professional data, directly from the source. Cons: No bulk export (against ToS), no phone numbers, manual research required.</p>

        <h2>One-Time Enrichment Services</h2>

        <p>Instead of a platform subscription, you can pay for one-time enrichment projects.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>

        <p>You export your contacts, send them to an enrichment service, they research and append data, you import the enriched file back to HubSpot.</p>

        <p>Pricing is usually per-record (e.g., $0.10-$1.00 per contact depending on data depth and research required). No ongoing subscription.</p>

        <h3>When One-Time Makes Sense</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>You have a specific segment to enrich (not your whole database)</li>
          <li>You need a one-time cleanup before a campaign or initiative</li>
          <li>You can't justify ongoing platform costs</li>
          <li>Your database doesn't change rapidly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Providers</h3>

        <p>Several firms (including us) offer enrichment as a service. You get the enriched data without the platform commitment. The tradeoff is that data can become stale after the initial enrichment.</p>

        <h2>DIY Enrichment</h2>

        <p>For smaller databases or specific segments, manual research might be cost-effective.</p>

        <h3>LinkedIn Research</h3>

        <p>For high-value contacts, manual LinkedIn lookup can verify and update title, company, and location. Time-intensive but accurate and free (assuming you have LinkedIn access).</p>

        <h3>Company Websites</h3>

        <p>For company-level data, check the company's website, About page, and press releases. Employee count, funding, and locations are often publicly available.</p>

        <h3>Free Tools</h3>

        <p>Tools like Hunter's free tier, Apollo's free tier, and various browser extensions can help with small-scale enrichment. The limits are tight, but for a few hundred contacts, it works.</p>

        <h3>When DIY Works</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>You have a small, high-value segment (under 500 contacts)</li>
          <li>You have an SDR or intern who can do the research</li>
          <li>Accuracy matters more than speed</li>
          <li>You can't spend money on tools</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Evaluating Enrichment Quality</h2>

        <p>Not all enrichment is created equal. How to assess providers.</p>

        <h3>Match Rate</h3>

        <p>What percentage of your records can they enrich? Ask for a test batch. Export 500-1000 contacts, let the provider run enrichment, see how many come back with data.</p>

        <p>Typical match rates for US B2B data: 70-85% for major providers on mid-size to large companies. Smaller companies, international contacts, and recent job changers have lower match rates.</p>

        <h3>Data Accuracy</h3>

        <p>Matched data isn't always correct data. Spot-check enriched records against LinkedIn and company websites. If 20% of job titles are wrong, the match rate doesn't matter.</p>

        <h3>Data Freshness</h3>

        <p>When was the data last verified? B2B data decays at roughly 30% per year (according to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/crm-data-decay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot research on CRM data decay</a>). If the provider's database hasn't been updated recently, you're getting stale information.</p>

        <h3>Coverage Gaps</h3>

        <p>Most providers have strengths and weaknesses. ZoomInfo is strong in US enterprise. Cognism is strong in Europe. Apollo is broad but shallower. Understand where your database lives and pick a provider that matches.</p>

        <h2>Integration With HubSpot</h2>

        <p>How you get enriched data into HubSpot matters.</p>

        <h3>Native Integration</h3>

        <p>Some tools (Breeze Intelligence, Apollo, ZoomInfo) have native HubSpot integrations. Data flows automatically. This is the easiest approach but limits you to providers with integrations.</p>

        <h3>Workflow Integration</h3>

        <p>Tools like Clearbit (via Breeze) can trigger enrichment as part of workflows. A new contact is created, enrichment runs automatically, data populates without manual intervention.</p>

        <h3>Manual Import</h3>

        <p>Export contacts, enrich externally, import enriched data back to HubSpot. More work but works with any provider. Make sure you match on a unique identifier (email or record ID) to avoid duplicates.</p>

        <h3>API Integration</h3>

        <p>If you have technical resources, many enrichment providers have APIs. You can build custom integrations that enrich on specific triggers or schedules.</p>

        <h2>Enrichment Strategy</h2>

        <p>Don't enrich everything. Enrich strategically.</p>

        <h3>Prioritize by Value</h3>

        <p>Focus enrichment budget on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>MQLs and SQLs:</strong> Active pipeline contacts who sales will engage with.</li>
          <li><strong>Target accounts:</strong> Key companies you're actively pursuing.</li>
          <li><strong>Recent converters:</strong> People who just filled out a form and are being routed/scored.</li>
          <li><strong>High-fit ICP contacts:</strong> Contacts matching your <a href="/glossary/ideal-customer-profile/">ideal customer profile</a> who are missing key data.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Don't spend money enriching ancient, disengaged contacts you're never going to email again.</p>

        <h3>Continuous vs. Point-in-Time</h3>

        <p><strong>Continuous enrichment:</strong> Data is enriched as it enters the system and re-verified periodically. Requires ongoing subscription. Best for companies with high lead volume and active sales motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Point-in-time enrichment:</strong> One-time projects to clean and enrich a specific segment. Good for companies with lower lead volume or tighter budgets. Accept that data ages and re-enrich when needed.</p>

        <h3>Layered Approach</h3>

        <p>You don't have to pick one provider. Some companies use:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>HubSpot's native enrichment for basic company data</li>
          <li>Apollo's free tier for ad-hoc research</li>
          <li>A one-time enrichment service for their high-priority segment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This layered approach costs less than a single enterprise platform while covering most needs.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What enrichment is available natively in HubSpot?</h3>
          <p>HubSpot auto-populates some company data (industry, size, description) when you add a domain. This works better for large, well-known companies. For contact-level enrichment, you need Breeze Intelligence or a third-party tool.</p>

          <h3>What's a realistic match rate for B2B enrichment?</h3>
          <p>For US B2B contacts at mid-size or larger companies, expect 70-85% from major providers. Smaller companies, international contacts, and recent job changers have lower rates (40-60%). No provider matches everything.</p>

          <h3>Should I enrich all my contacts?</h3>
          <p>No. Enrich strategically. High-value contacts (MQLs, target accounts, recent converters) are worth the cost. Old, disengaged contacts probably aren't. Better ROI comes from enriching a focused segment thoroughly.</p>

          <h3>How do I keep enriched data fresh?</h3>
          <p>Data decays at roughly <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/crm-data-decay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% per year</a>. Options include: continuous enrichment subscriptions with re-verification, quarterly refreshes for active contacts, or accepting aging and re-enriching when contacts become active again.</p>
