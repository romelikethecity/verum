        <h2>Direct Mail to Nowhere</h2>

        <p>You print 10,000 mailers. Pay for design, printing, postage. Drop them at the post office. And 800 of them come back undeliverable. Bad addresses, incomplete information, businesses that moved.</p>

        <p>That's 8% of your budget wasted. Plus the damage to your brand when mail arrives at the wrong place, or doesn't arrive at all.</p>

        <p>Address validation catches these problems before you spend money on postage. We verify every address against USPS databases, correct formatting issues, and flag addresses that won't deliver.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"Our undeliverable rate dropped from 12% to under 2%. Paid for the validation with the first mailing."</blockquote>

        <h2>What We Check</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>USPS verification.</strong> Does this address exist in the postal database? Is it a valid, deliverable location?</li>

          <li><strong>Format standardization.</strong> Correct abbreviations, proper casing, USPS-standard formatting. "Street" becomes "St", "Avenue" becomes "Ave".</li>

          <li><strong>Component parsing.</strong> Break addresses into components: street number, street name, unit, city, state, ZIP. Catch missing pieces.</li>

          <li><strong>ZIP+4 completion.</strong> Append the 4-digit extension for more precise delivery. Often required for bulk mail discounts.</li>

          <li><strong>Residential vs commercial.</strong> Is this a business address or residential? Important for B2B targeting.</li>

          <li><strong>Vacancy detection.</strong> Is this address currently occupied? Catch vacant properties before mailing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Address Problems We Fix</h2>

        <p><strong>Incomplete addresses.</strong> Missing apartment numbers, suite designations, or directional prefixes. "123 Main" vs "123 N Main St Ste 200".</p>

        <p><strong>Misspellings.</strong> "Philladelphia" → "Philadelphia". "Callifornia" → "California". Common errors that cause delivery failures.</p>

        <p><strong>Wrong ZIP codes.</strong> City and ZIP don't match. Street doesn't exist in that ZIP. Address got corrupted somewhere.</p>

        <p><strong>Outdated information.</strong> Street names change. ZIP codes get reassigned. Cities annex new areas. Old data doesn't deliver.</p>

        <p><strong>Suite and unit issues.</strong> Missing suite numbers for commercial buildings. Wrong unit designations for multi-tenant addresses.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Validation status.</strong> Valid, invalid, or correctable. Each address categorized.</p>

        <p><strong>Standardized format.</strong> USPS-compliant formatting ready for mailing.</p>

        <p><strong>Corrections applied.</strong> Spelling fixes, abbreviation standardization, ZIP+4 appended.</p>

        <p><strong>Delivery point verification.</strong> Confirmation that mail can actually be delivered to this specific address.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your addresses.</strong> Any format. We parse and normalize everything.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We validate against USPS databases.</strong> Every address checked for deliverability.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Corrections applied.</strong> Formatting fixed, missing components added, errors corrected.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Results delivered.</strong> Clean addresses ready for mailing, with status on every record.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Address validation runs $0.01-0.03 per address, depending on volume and validation depth.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Most lists are validated within 24 hours.</p>

        <h2>Stop Wasting Postage</h2>

        <p>Every undeliverable piece is money thrown away. Validate your addresses before you print, and every piece has a chance of reaching its destination.</p>
