        <h2>Businesses Change. Your Data Doesn't.</h2>

        <p>Every year, 30% of B2B data becomes obsolete. Companies close. Get acquired. Merge with competitors. Relocate to different addresses. Change their names entirely.</p>

        <p>Your database doesn't know any of this. It still shows the company as active, at the old address, with the old name. Your reps call, email, and visit locations that don't exist anymore.</p>

        <p>Business status validation catches these changes before you waste outreach. We verify each company is still operating, at the expected location, under the expected name.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We found 400 closed practices in our database of 3,000. That's 400 accounts we would have kept calling forever."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Territory Manager, Medical Device Company</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Check</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Operating status.</strong> Is the business currently active? Open for business, or permanently closed?</li>

          <li><strong>Acquisition detection.</strong> Has this company been acquired? By whom? Is the original entity still operating?</li>

          <li><strong>Merger identification.</strong> Did this company merge with another? What's the new entity called?</li>

          <li><strong>Relocation tracking.</strong> Did the business move? Where's the new address?</li>

          <li><strong>Name change detection.</strong> Did the company rebrand? What's it called now?</li>

          <li><strong>Website status.</strong> Is the company website still active? Often the first sign of trouble.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Verify</h2>

        <p>We don't rely on a single source. Business status requires cross-referencing multiple databases:</p>

        <p><strong>Business registries.</strong> State and federal records showing incorporation status, registered agents, and legal standing.</p>

        <p><strong>Public records.</strong> Court filings, UCC records, liens, and bankruptcies that indicate business health.</p>

        <p><strong>Web presence.</strong> Website status, social media activity, recent news mentions. Signs of life.</p>

        <p><strong>Location data.</strong> Google Maps, Yelp, and other sources that show whether a business is still at its listed address.</p>

        <p><strong>Phone verification.</strong> Does the listed phone number still connect to this business?</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Status classification.</strong> Active, closed, acquired, merged, relocated, or unknown. Each business categorized.</p>

        <p><strong>Change details.</strong> When available: acquisition date, acquiring company, new address, new name.</p>

        <p><strong>Confidence score.</strong> How certain are we about this status? High confidence vs needs manual review.</p>

        <p><strong>Source attribution.</strong> Which sources confirmed this status? Useful for audit and compliance.</p>

        <h2>Who Needs This</h2>

        <p><strong>Sales teams with territory databases.</strong> Stop calling businesses that closed. Focus on companies that can actually buy.</p>

        <p><strong>Healthcare and medical device companies.</strong> Practices close, relocate, and get acquired constantly. Stay current.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing teams before campaigns.</strong> Don't send mailers to addresses where businesses don't exist.</p>

        <p><strong>Data teams during CRM cleanup.</strong> Find and flag records that shouldn't be in your active pipeline.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Business status validation runs $0.05-0.15 per record, depending on validation depth and volume.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Results typically delivered within 48-72 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How accurate is business status validation?</h3>
          <p>Accuracy depends on the business type and available data. For most B2B companies, we achieve 85-95% accuracy on status classification.</p>

          <h3>Can you tell why a business closed?</h3>
          <p>Sometimes. When public records are available (bankruptcy, dissolution filings), we include that information. But many closures happen quietly without public documentation.</p>

          <h3>How current is the data?</h3>
          <p>We validate at the time of your project using current sources. For ongoing freshness, consider our maintenance services.</p>

          <h3>What about franchises?</h3>
          <p>Franchise locations are validated individually. A franchise brand being active doesn't mean every location is open.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Stop Calling Ghosts</h2>

        <p>Every closed business in your database is wasted effort. Validate your accounts and focus on companies that can actually become customers.</p>
