        <h2>Healthcare Data Has Special Requirements</h2>

        <p>When you're selling to healthcare providers, you need more than a name and phone number. You need to know they're actually credentialed. That their NPI is active. That they're practicing at the location you have on file.</p>

        <p>The NPI Registry is the authoritative source for provider credentials. But checking it manually is tedious. One provider at a time, copying and pasting, hoping you don't make mistakes.</p>

        <p>We validate your entire database against the NPI Registry automatically. Every provider checked, every credential verified, every discrepancy flagged.</p>

        <div class="testimonial mt-xl mb-xl">
          <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">"We found 200 providers with deactivated NPIs and 150 who had moved to different practices. That's 350 records our reps would have wasted time on."</blockquote>
          <cite class="testimonial__author">— Sales Operations Director, Medical Device Company</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Validate</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>NPI status.</strong> Is this NPI currently active? Deactivated NPIs mean the provider isn't practicing.</li>

          <li><strong>Provider name matching.</strong> Does the name in your database match the NPI Registry? Catch data entry errors and outdated records.</li>

          <li><strong>Specialty verification.</strong> Is this provider actually in the specialty you're targeting? Taxonomy codes don't lie.</li>

          <li><strong>Practice location.</strong> Is the provider at the address you have? NPI Registry shows primary and secondary practice locations.</li>

          <li><strong>Entity type.</strong> Individual provider (Type 1) or organization (Type 2)? Different entity types need different approaches.</li>

          <li><strong>Credential verification.</strong> MD, DO, NP, PA? Verify the credential matches what's in your database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Issues We Catch</h2>

        <p><strong>Deactivated NPIs.</strong> Provider retired, lost license, or stopped practicing. NPI was deactivated but your database doesn't know.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice changes.</strong> Provider moved to a different practice. NPI is still active, but the address is wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>Specialty mismatches.</strong> Your database says cardiologist, NPI Registry says family medicine. Wrong target.</p>

        <p><strong>Name discrepancies.</strong> Database has "Dr. Smith", NPI has "Jane Smith-Jones". Same person, but automation doesn't match them.</p>

        <p><strong>Wrong entity type.</strong> You have a practice NPI but you're trying to reach an individual. Different outreach needed.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>

        <p><strong>Validation status.</strong> Verified, unverified, or discrepancy found. Each provider categorized.</p>

        <p><strong>NPI Registry data.</strong> Current information from the registry: name, specialty, practice locations, credentials.</p>

        <p><strong>Discrepancy flags.</strong> Specific issues identified: wrong specialty, wrong address, name mismatch.</p>

        <p><strong>Recommendations.</strong> Which records to keep, which to update, which to remove.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Send us your provider data.</strong> Name, NPI (if you have it), address, specialty. Whatever you have.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: We match against the NPI Registry.</strong> Every provider checked against the official federal database.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Discrepancies flagged.</strong> Issues identified with specific details on what's wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Results delivered.</strong> Validated file with status on every provider, plus summary report.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>NPI validation runs $0.03-0.05 per provider, depending on volume and validation depth.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Results typically delivered within 24-48 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>What if I don't have NPIs in my database?</h3>
          <p>We can match providers by name and address to find their NPIs. Match rates depend on data quality, but typically 70-90% of valid providers can be matched.</p>

          <h3>How current is the NPI Registry data?</h3>
          <p>We use the most current NPPES data available, typically updated weekly. For real-time validation needs, we can check directly against the live registry.</p>

          <h3>Can you validate organization NPIs?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Type 2 (organization) NPIs are validated the same way as Type 1 (individual) NPIs. Practices, hospitals, group practices.</p>

          <h3>What about providers with multiple NPIs?</h3>
          <p>We validate the NPI you provide. If you need to find all NPIs associated with a provider, that's a separate lookup we can do.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Sell to Real Providers</h2>

        <p>Healthcare sales is hard enough without chasing providers who aren't credentialed, aren't practicing, or aren't where you think they are. Validate your database and focus on real opportunities.</p>
