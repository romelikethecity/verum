        <h2>Who Sells to Healthcare Businesses</h2>

        <p>Healthcare is the largest industry in the US economy. Businesses that serve healthcare providers range from medical equipment to billing software to office supplies. Different products reach different decision-makers.</p>

        <p><strong>Medical equipment and supplies.</strong> Clinical equipment, exam tables, diagnostic devices, disposable supplies. Physicians and office managers make these decisions at independent practices. Procurement departments handle it at larger organizations.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice management software.</strong> EHR, scheduling, billing, patient communication. Technology decisions are made by physicians, office managers, or IT directors depending on practice size. These purchases are sticky once made.</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue cycle management.</strong> Billing services, coding assistance, claims management, denial recovery. Practice administrators control these decisions. The pain of managing revenue cycle in-house drives outsourcing.</p>

        <p><strong>Staffing and recruiting.</strong> Healthcare has chronic staffing shortages. Nurses, medical assistants, administrative staff. Staffing agencies target practice managers and HR leaders at larger organizations.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing services.</strong> Patient acquisition, reputation management, website development, SEO. The physician owner or practice administrator decides. Most practices know they should do more marketing.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance and credentialing.</strong> HIPAA compliance, credentialing services, regulatory consulting. Required activities that practices often outsource.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Practice loans, equipment financing, merchant services, retirement plans. Independent practice owners need these just like other business owners.</p>
