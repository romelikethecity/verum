        <h2>Who Sells to Law Firms</h2>

        <p>Law firms are professional service businesses with specific vendor needs. They're conservative buyers but spend heavily on what they need. Different products reach different people in the firm.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice management software.</strong> Case management, document management, time tracking, billing. The managing partner or administrator evaluates these at smaller firms. IT directors handle it at larger ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Legal research tools.</strong> Beyond Westlaw and Lexis, there's a growing market for specialized research tools. Practice group leaders and individual attorneys influence these decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing and business development.</strong> Websites, SEO, content marketing, client development coaching. Marketing directors at mid-size firms, managing partners at smaller ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Staffing and recruiting.</strong> Legal staffing, paralegal placement, associate recruiting. HR managers at large firms, administrators at smaller ones. Legal talent is competitive and expensive.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Trust accounting, client payment processing, practice loans, E&O insurance. The managing partner or CFO handles these decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Office services.</strong> Court reporting, process serving, document scanning, legal copying. Operations managers and paralegals use these services regularly.</p>

        <p><strong>CLE and training.</strong> Continuing legal education, practice management training, technology training. Attorneys need CLE credits. Training companies target individual attorneys and firm administrators.</p>
