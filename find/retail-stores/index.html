        <h2>Who Sells to Retail Stores</h2>

        <p>Retail stores are a huge market for B2B vendors. They buy products to sell, technology to run operations, services to support the business, and supplies to keep the doors open. The challenge is reaching the right stores with the right offer.</p>

        <p><strong>Wholesale products.</strong> Manufacturers and distributors looking for retail distribution. Independent retailers are often more accessible than big chains for new products trying to get shelf space.</p>

        <p><strong>Point of sale and technology.</strong> POS systems, inventory management, e-commerce platforms, loyalty programs. Retailers need technology to compete, but most can't afford enterprise solutions.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Merchant processing, working capital, inventory financing. Retail has thin margins and cash flow volatility. Financial services vendors have a ready market.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing.</strong> Local advertising, Google Business optimization, social media, signage. Retailers need foot traffic and visibility. Marketing vendors help them compete with online and big box.</p>

        <p><strong>Fixtures and supplies.</strong> Shelving, displays, bags, packaging, receipt paper, security systems. Every retail store has ongoing supply needs.</p>

        <p><strong>Services.</strong> Insurance, security, cleaning, HR, accounting. Retail stores need the same business services as other small businesses.</p>
