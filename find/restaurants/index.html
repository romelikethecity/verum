        <h2>Who Sells to Restaurants</h2>

        <p>Restaurants are one of the most actively targeted B2B markets. They buy constantly, they're easy to identify, and there are hundreds of thousands of them. The challenge is reaching the right decision-maker at the right time with the right offer.</p>

        <p><strong>Food and beverage.</strong> Broadline distributors, specialty food suppliers, beverage companies, local farms. Every restaurant buys food, and most are open to trying new suppliers if the quality and price are right.</p>

        <p><strong>Equipment and supplies.</strong> Kitchen equipment, smallwares, furniture, tabletop, cleaning supplies, packaging. Restaurants replace and upgrade constantly. New restaurants need everything.</p>

        <p><strong>Technology.</strong> Point of sale, online ordering, inventory management, scheduling, reservation systems. Restaurant tech is one of the fastest-growing B2B categories. Owners and operators are the buyers.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Payment processing, working capital, equipment financing, payroll services. Restaurants have high transaction volume and often need cash flow solutions.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing.</strong> Third-party delivery, loyalty programs, local advertising, social media management, review platforms. Restaurants need customers, and marketing vendors help them get them.</p>

        <p><strong>Services.</strong> Pest control, grease trap cleaning, equipment maintenance, linen service. Restaurants have ongoing service needs that create recurring revenue for vendors.</p>
