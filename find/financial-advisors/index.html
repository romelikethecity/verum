        <h2>Who Sells to Financial Advisors</h2>

        <p>Financial advisors spend money on two things: tools that help them serve clients better and services that help them grow their practice. Different products reach different people in advisory firms.</p>

        <p><strong>Technology platforms.</strong> Portfolio management systems, financial planning software, CRM, client portals, reporting tools. The firm principal or operations lead evaluates these. Technology decisions are sticky once made.</p>

        <p><strong>Custodians and asset managers.</strong> RIAs need custodians. Asset managers want shelf space. These relationships are cultivated over time with the principal and key advisors.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance and regulatory.</strong> Compliance software, regulatory filing services, audit support. The CCO (Chief Compliance Officer) handles these. At small RIAs, that's often the owner wearing another hat.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing services.</strong> Websites, content marketing, lead generation, seminar marketing. Most advisors want more clients. Few know how to market effectively. Operations managers or the principal make these decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice management consulting.</strong> Business coaching, succession planning, M&A advisory. Principals of growing firms want guidance on scaling. Retiring advisors need exit strategies.</p>

        <p><strong>Insurance products.</strong> E&O insurance, cyber liability, client-facing insurance products for cross-selling. The principal handles firm insurance. Individual advisors may have authority to recommend client products.</p>

        <p><strong>Broker-dealers.</strong> FINRA-registered. Commission-based or hybrid models. Large wirehouses down to independent broker-dealers.</p>

        <p><strong>Independent advisors.</strong> Solo practitioners or small teams. The advisor is the business. Decisions are quick but budgets are smaller.</p>

        <p><strong>Multi-advisor firms.</strong> Multiple advisors under common ownership or affiliation. May have dedicated operations staff. Larger deals but longer sales cycles.</p>

        <p><strong>By AUM tier.</strong> Emerging ($0-100M), established ($100M-500M), large ($500M-1B), enterprise ($1B+). AUM correlates with technology spend and sophistication.</p>
