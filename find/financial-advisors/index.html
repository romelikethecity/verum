      <p class="page-hero__subtitle">FINRA BrokerCheck and SEC IAPD are public, but extracting clean lists from them is a nightmare.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="content">
    <div class="container" style="max-width: 800px;">
      
<p>Verum builds financial advisor lists by pulling from FINRA BrokerCheck, SEC Investment Adviser Public Disclosure, state securities regulators, and professional association databases. We deliver verified contact info for RIAs, broker-dealer reps, CFPs, and independent advisors that you can actually reach.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Financial advisor data is technically public through regulatory databases, but those systems are designed for compliance lookups, not list building. You can search one advisor at a time on BrokerCheck, but you can't export a list of every RIA in Texas with over $50M AUM. That's where we come in.</p>

<h2>How We Build Financial Advisor Lists</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FINRA BrokerCheck extraction.</strong> We systematically pull registered representative data including firm affiliations, license types (Series 7, 66, 65), and disclosed customer complaints.</li>
  <li><strong>SEC IAPD mining.</strong> Investment Adviser Public Disclosure records give us RIA firm details, AUM figures, fee structures, and the individual Investment Adviser Representatives at each firm.</li>
  <li><strong>CFP Board and designation matching.</strong> We cross-reference CFP, CFA, ChFC, and other designation holders to identify advisors with specific credentials you're targeting.</li>
  <li><strong>Independent vs. wirehouse classification.</strong> We tag whether advisors work at wirehouses (Merrill, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Wells), regional B-Ds, or independent RIAs, since these segments buy differently.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct contact discovery.</strong> We find personal emails and direct phone lines, not the branch receptionist number that rings to a compliance-monitored line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your Financial Advisor List Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advisor name and CRD number.</strong> Unique Central Registration Depository number that links to their full regulatory history.</li>
  <li><strong>Firm and channel.</strong> Which firm they're registered through and whether it's a wirehouse, independent B-D, RIA, or hybrid.</li>
  <li><strong>Licenses and designations.</strong> Series 7, 66, 65, CFP, CFA, ChFC, CLU, and other credentials that indicate their practice type.</li>
  <li><strong>AUM and client indicators.</strong> For RIA firms, we include reported assets under management. For individual reps, we estimate practice size from available signals.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct contact information.</strong> Verified email and phone number for the advisor, not the branch or compliance department.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can you filter financial advisors by AUM or practice size?</h3>
<p>For RIA firms, yes. SEC filings (Form ADV) include reported AUM, which we use as a direct filter. For individual reps at broker-dealers, exact AUM isn't publicly disclosed, but we can estimate practice size using team size, branch location, and production signals.</p>

<h3>How do you handle advisors who are dually registered?</h3>
<p>We identify dual-registration (advisors holding both B-D and RIA registrations) and tag it in the data. This matters for compliance and product suitability conversations. About 30% of advisors operate in a hybrid model, and we flag exactly which registrations they hold.</p>

<h3>Can you separate fee-only RIAs from commission-based advisors?</h3>
<p>Yes. Form ADV disclosures include compensation structure. We tag advisors as fee-only, commission-only, or fee-and-commission. This is important if you sell products or services that only work within specific compensation models.</p>
