        <h2>Who Sells to Insurance Agencies</h2>

        <p>Insurance agencies are small businesses with specific needs. They manage client relationships, process paperwork, and navigate carrier requirements. Different products reach different people in the agency.</p>

        <p><strong>Agency management systems.</strong> Policy management, client tracking, workflow automation. The agency owner or principal evaluates these. Technology decisions are sticky once made.</p>

        <p><strong>Carrier appointments.</strong> Insurance carriers recruit agents. Independent agencies want access to more markets. Carrier distribution teams target producing agents and agency owners.</p>

        <p><strong>Lead generation.</strong> Insurance agents need prospects. Leads, referral programs, marketing services. The agency owner or top producers control this spend.</p>

        <p><strong>Comparative rating tools.</strong> Software that lets agents quote multiple carriers quickly. Independent agents especially need these tools. Agency owners and producers both use them.</p>

        <p><strong>E&O insurance.</strong> Errors and omissions coverage is required. Agencies shop this regularly. The owner handles insurance decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing services.</strong> Websites, social media, direct mail, local advertising. Most agencies know they should do more marketing but don't know where to start.</p>

        <p><strong>Office services.</strong> Phone systems, IT support, office equipment. Standard small business needs. The owner or office manager handles these.</p>
