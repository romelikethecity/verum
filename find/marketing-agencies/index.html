      <p class="page-hero__subtitle">Marketing agency directories are cluttered with freelancers calling themselves agencies and dead shops that never took down their website.</p>

<p>Verum builds marketing agency lists that separate real agencies from solo freelancers, inactive operations, and vanity websites. We identify the agency owner or managing director and deliver direct contact info for the person who makes technology, vendor, and partnership decisions.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Anyone with a WordPress site can call themselves a marketing agency. Clutch, UpCity, and similar directories list thousands of agencies, but many are one-person shops or inactive businesses. Filtering for real agencies with actual teams and active client rosters requires cross-referencing multiple signals.</p>

<h2>How We Build Marketing Agency Lists</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employee and team size validation.</strong> We verify actual team size through LinkedIn employee counts, job postings, and website team page analysis to separate real agencies from solo operators.</li>
  <li><strong>Active client and project signals.</strong> Case studies, portfolio work, client logos, and recent social media activity confirm the agency is actively doing work, not just maintaining a website.</li>
  <li><strong>Specialization tagging.</strong> We classify agencies by their focus: SEO, PPC, social media, content marketing, branding, web development, PR, video production, email marketing, and full-service.</li>
  <li><strong>Owner and leadership identification.</strong> We find the founder, managing director, or VP who makes vendor and technology decisions, as opposed to the account manager or social media coordinator listed as the primary contact.</li>
  <li><strong>Agency model classification.</strong> We tag agencies by model: full-service, specialist, boutique, holding company subsidiary, or white-label reseller.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your Marketing Agency List Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Agency owner or MD contact.</strong> Direct email and phone for the decision-maker, not the info@ address or intake form.</li>
  <li><strong>Agency specialization.</strong> Primary and secondary service focuses, tagged by channel and discipline.</li>
  <li><strong>Team size and structure.</strong> Verified employee count and whether they use contractors, offshore teams, or in-house only.</li>
  <li><strong>Client industry focus.</strong> Which verticals they primarily serve: B2B SaaS, healthcare, ecommerce, local business, financial services, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Location and service model.</strong> Physical office location, remote-first status, and whether they serve local, national, or international clients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can you filter for agencies of a specific size?</h3>
<p>Yes. We classify agencies by team size: solo/freelancer (1), micro (2-5), small (6-15), mid-size (16-50), and large (50+). If you're selling an agency management platform, you probably want agencies with 10+ people. If you're selling white-label services, micro agencies might be your sweet spot.</p>

<h3>How do you verify an agency is actually active?</h3>
<p>We check multiple signals: recent website updates, active social media posting, current job openings, new case studies or portfolio pieces, and employee activity on LinkedIn. An agency with a beautiful website but no activity in 18 months gets flagged or excluded.</p>

<h3>Can you find agencies that specialize in a particular industry?</h3>
<p>Yes. Many agencies specialize in verticals like healthcare, financial services, real estate, or SaaS. We identify industry focus through website copy, case studies, and client logos. If you need agencies that specifically serve the healthcare vertical, we can build that list.</p>
