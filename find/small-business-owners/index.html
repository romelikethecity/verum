        <h2>Who Sells to Small Business Owners</h2>

        <p>Small business owners wear multiple hats and make all the decisions. Unlike enterprise sales where you need to navigate committees and procurement, small business sales come down to one person saying yes. The challenge is reaching that person efficiently.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Business loans, lines of credit, merchant services, insurance, retirement plans, bookkeeping. Small business owners need these services but rarely have time to shop around. The vendor who reaches them at the right moment wins.</p>

        <p><strong>Business software.</strong> Accounting, payroll, point of sale, scheduling, CRM, invoicing. Small businesses are the biggest market for business software, but they're also the hardest to reach because they're not on LinkedIn all day.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing services.</strong> Websites, SEO, social media, direct mail, advertising. Most small business owners know they should market more but don't know where to start. They buy from people who make it simple.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional services.</strong> Accounting, legal, HR, IT support. Small businesses often can't afford full-time staff in these areas. Outsourced services fill the gap.</p>

        <p><strong>Equipment and supplies.</strong> Industry-specific equipment, office supplies, uniforms, signage. Small businesses buy constantly, but from vendors they trust.</p>

        <p><strong>Franchise and business opportunity.</strong> Franchise systems, business coaching, industry associations. Small business owners are often looking to grow or improve.</p>
