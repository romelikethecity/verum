        <h2>Who Sells to Restaurant Owners</h2>

        <p>Restaurants are purchasing machines. They buy food, equipment, supplies, technology, and services constantly. They also have notoriously thin margins, which means they're price-sensitive but also always looking for ways to reduce costs or increase revenue.</p>

        <p><strong>Food and beverage distributors.</strong> Sysco and US Foods have much of the market, but there's room for specialty distributors, local suppliers, and niche products. Owners and kitchen managers make these decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Restaurant equipment.</strong> Ovens, refrigeration, smallwares, furniture, signage. New restaurants need everything. Existing restaurants replace and upgrade. Equipment companies sell to owners and operators.</p>

        <p><strong>Technology.</strong> POS systems, online ordering, reservation systems, inventory management, kitchen display systems. Restaurant tech is booming. Owners make these decisions, sometimes with input from managers.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing and delivery.</strong> Third-party delivery, loyalty programs, social media marketing, review management. Restaurants need customers, and they're willing to pay for tools that drive traffic.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Merchant processing, working capital loans, equipment financing. Restaurants have high transaction volume and cash flow challenges. Financial services vendors target them heavily.</p>

        <p><strong>Staffing and HR.</strong> Restaurant turnover runs 75%+ annually. Staffing agencies, HR software, and training companies have a built-in market.</p>

        <h2>Restaurant Segments</h2>

        <p><strong>By service type.</strong> Full-service restaurants (table service) vs quick-service (counter service) vs fast casual (quick with higher quality). Very different operations, different needs.</p>

        <p><strong>By concept.</strong> Fine dining, casual dining, family restaurants, bars and taverns, cafes, catering operations, food trucks. Each has distinct purchasing patterns.</p>

        <p><strong>By ownership.</strong> Independent operators make all decisions. Franchisees have some purchasing mandates and some flexibility. Corporate restaurants centralize most purchasing.</p>

        <p><strong>By scale.</strong> Single-location independents, small groups (2-5 locations), regional operators (6-20), large franchisees (20+). Multi-unit operators are high-value targets.</p>

        <p><strong>By geography.</strong> Urban, suburban, rural. Tourist areas vs residential neighborhoods. Location type affects menu, pricing, and vendor needs.</p>
