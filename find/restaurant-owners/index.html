      <h1 class="page-hero__title">Restaurant Owners</h1>
      <p class="page-hero__subtitle">Restaurant ownership is a tangled web of LLCs, management companies, and operators who own multiple concepts under different names.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="content">
    <div class="container" style="max-width: 800px;">
      
<p>Verum finds the actual people behind restaurant ownership, not just the brand name on the sign. We trace through LLC structures, management companies, and multi-concept operators to identify the individual who makes purchasing decisions for equipment, technology, supplies, and services.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Restaurant owners hide behind LLCs for liability reasons, and multi-unit operators create separate entities for each location. The person listed on the health permit might be a manager, not the owner. Franchise restaurants add another layer of complexity since the franchisee's name isn't on any public-facing material.</p>

<h2>How We Track Down Restaurant Owners</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Health department permit analysis.</strong> Food service permits list a responsible party, which is often the owner or managing member. We pull these records from county health departments across your target markets.</li>
  <li><strong>Liquor license cross-referencing.</strong> Alcohol licenses require disclosure of ownership interests above certain thresholds. These filings frequently reveal the actual owner when other records don't.</li>
  <li><strong>Secretary of State entity matching.</strong> Each restaurant typically operates under its own LLC. We match the restaurant address to its corporate entity and trace ownership to the individual behind it.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-concept operator grouping.</strong> We link restaurants owned by the same individual or management company, revealing operators who run 3, 10, or 50 locations across different brands and concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct contact discovery.</strong> Once we've identified the owner, we find their personal email and mobile number, since restaurant owners rarely sit at a desk with a direct office line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your Restaurant Owner List Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Owner name and personal contact info.</strong> Direct email and mobile number for the individual owner, not the restaurant's reservation line.</li>
  <li><strong>Restaurant details.</strong> Concept name, cuisine type, service style (QSR, fast casual, full service, fine dining), and location.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-unit footprint.</strong> Total number of locations the owner operates, across all their brands and concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Ownership structure.</strong> Independent owner-operator, multi-concept group, franchise, or management company. Your pitch changes for each.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational indicators.</strong> Liquor license status, years in operation, and estimated seat count where available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can you find owners of specific types of restaurants?</h3>
<p>Yes. We can filter by cuisine type, service style (QSR, fast casual, casual dining, fine dining), and concept type (independent, chain, franchise). If you're selling a POS system for fast casual restaurants, we'll build a list of fast casual owner-operators in your target markets.</p>

<h3>How do you handle restaurant franchise owners?</h3>
<p>Franchise restaurant owners are identified through a combination of state business filings, franchise agreement signals, and local permit records. We separate franchisees from corporate-owned locations and give you the local franchisee's contact info, not the franchisor's corporate office.</p>

<h3>Can you find restaurant owners who operate multiple locations?</h3>
<p>That's one of our specialties. Multi-unit operators are high-value prospects because they make purchasing decisions for multiple locations at once. We group all of an owner's locations together and flag their total unit count, regardless of how many different LLCs or brand names they use.</p>
