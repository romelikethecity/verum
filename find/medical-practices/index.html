        <h2>Who Sells to Medical Practices</h2>

        <p>Medical practices are sophisticated buyers with specific needs. They purchase clinical equipment, technology, professional services, and operational support. Different products reach different decision-makers within practices.</p>

        <p><strong>Medical equipment and supplies.</strong> Clinical equipment, exam tables, diagnostic devices, disposable supplies. Physicians influence clinical purchases. Office managers handle supplies and consumables.</p>

        <p><strong>EHR and practice management software.</strong> Electronic health records, scheduling, billing, patient communication. Major technology decisions are made by physicians and administrators together. These are sticky purchases.</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue cycle management.</strong> Billing services, coding, claims management, denial recovery. Practice administrators control these decisions. The complexity of medical billing drives outsourcing.</p>

        <p><strong>Staffing and recruiting.</strong> Physicians, nurses, medical assistants, administrative staff. Healthcare has chronic staffing shortages. Practice managers and HR handle recruiting.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing services.</strong> Patient acquisition, reputation management, website development. The physician owner or practice administrator decides. Most practices want more patients but don't know how to market.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Practice loans, equipment financing, merchant services, retirement plans. Independent practice owners need these like other business owners.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance and credentialing.</strong> HIPAA compliance, credentialing services, regulatory consulting. Required activities that practices often outsource.</p>

        <h2>Data Fields Available</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Practice information.</strong> Name, address, phone, website, NPI number, years in business.</li>

          <li><strong>Physician contacts.</strong> Name, credentials (MD, DO), specialty, direct email, direct phone when available.</li>

          <li><strong>Specialty classification.</strong> Primary care, cardiology, orthopedics, dermatology, and 100+ specialties and subspecialties.</li>

          <li><strong>Administrative contacts.</strong> Practice administrator, office manager, billing manager, clinical director. Multiple contacts at larger practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Medical Practice Segments</h2>

        <p><strong>Solo practitioners.</strong> One physician practices. The physician is the owner and decision-maker. Quick decisions but limited budgets.</p>

        <p><strong>Small group practices (2-5 physicians).</strong> Shared overhead and resources. May have dedicated administrator. Partners typically decide together.</p>

        <p><strong>Large group practices (6+ physicians).</strong> More formal structure with administrative leadership, IT support, and purchasing processes.</p>

        <p><strong>Multi-specialty groups.</strong> Multiple specialties under one roof. Complex decision-making with specialty-specific and organizational needs.</p>

        <p><strong>By ownership.</strong> Independent physician-owned practices operate differently from practices owned by health systems or PE groups. Independent practices have more purchasing autonomy.</p>

        <p><strong>By specialty.</strong> Primary care (family, internal, pediatrics) vs specialists. Each specialty has different needs, procedures, and purchasing patterns.</p>
