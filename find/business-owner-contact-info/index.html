<p>Verum specializes in the last mile of business prospecting: getting verified contact info for the owner or decision-maker when all you have is a business name and address. We go beyond what's publicly listed to find direct emails, mobile numbers, and personal LinkedIn profiles.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Business directories give you the company phone number and a generic email. That's useless for outbound sales. The owner's personal contact info is scattered across state filings, domain records, social profiles, and professional databases that don't talk to each other.</p>

<h2>How We Find Owner Contact Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Corporate filing analysis.</strong> Secretary of State records, annual reports, and business registration documents reveal registered agents and officers with their contact details.</li>
  <li><strong>Domain and WHOIS research.</strong> Website registration records, email domain patterns, and catch-all configurations help us identify and verify owner email addresses.</li>
  <li><strong>Social profile correlation.</strong> We match owners to their LinkedIn, Facebook, and other social profiles to find additional contact vectors and confirm identity.</li>
  <li><strong>Public records aggregation.</strong> Property records, professional licenses, and other public filings are cross-referenced to build a complete contact picture.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-time email and phone verification.</strong> Every email gets deliverability tested. Every phone number gets carrier-verified and checked for active status before delivery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Get for Each Business Owner</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Verified personal email.</strong> The owner's actual inbox, tested for deliverability. Not info@ or contact@ addresses.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct phone number.</strong> Mobile or direct line, carrier-verified. We indicate whether it's a cell, landline, or VoIP number.</li>
  <li><strong>Full name and title.</strong> Owner, President, Managing Partner, CEO, or whatever their actual title is at the business.</li>
  <li><strong>LinkedIn profile URL.</strong> Matched and confirmed as belonging to the right person at the right company.</li>
  <li><strong>Confidence scores.</strong> Every data point gets a confidence rating so you know which contacts to prioritize.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>What if I already have a list of businesses and just need owner contact info?</h3>
<p>That's exactly what this service is for. Send us your list of business names and addresses, and we'll find the owner name, direct email, phone number, and LinkedIn for each one. Most clients see 60-80% match rates depending on the industry and business size.</p>

<h3>How is this different from buying a database?</h3>
<p>Databases go stale the moment they're built. We research each business fresh at the time you order. That means current ownership, working email addresses, and active phone numbers. No recycled data from 2019 that's been resold to a hundred other companies.</p>

<h3>What's your typical turnaround time?</h3>
<p>For lists under 500 businesses, we typically deliver in 2-3 business days. Larger lists of 1,000-5,000 take about a week. We prioritize accuracy over speed, but we're faster than doing it yourself by a factor of about 50x.</p>
