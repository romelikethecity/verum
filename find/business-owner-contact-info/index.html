        <h2>Why Owner Contact Info Matters</h2>

        <p>You've got a list of businesses. Maybe you scraped it, maybe you bought it, maybe you exported it from somewhere. It has company names, generic emails, main phone numbers. And it's not working.</p>

        <p>Generic emails go to info@ or contact@ addresses that nobody reads. Main phone numbers reach receptionists who send you to voicemail. Direct mail addressed to "Business Owner" gets thrown away. You're not reaching the person who can say yes.</p>

        <p>Owner contact information is different. It's the actual person's name. Their direct email, not the company inbox. Their direct line, not the main number. For direct mail, their name on the envelope instead of "Current Resident" or "Business Owner."</p>

        <p>The difference in response rates is dramatic. Personal outreach to a named individual converts 3-5x better than generic company contact. The research investment pays for itself on the first campaign.</p>

        <h2>What We Provide</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Owner name.</strong> The actual person who owns the business. First name, last name, properly formatted.</li>

          <li><strong>Direct email.</strong> Their personal business email, not info@ or contact@. Verified for deliverability before you send.</li>

          <li><strong>Direct phone.</strong> When available, their direct line or mobile. Not the main business number.</li>

          <li><strong>Mailing address.</strong> Business address for direct mail. The address on their business registration or where they receive professional mail.</li>

          <li><strong>Business information.</strong> Company name, industry, location, years in business, estimated revenue/employees.</li>

          <li><strong>Verification status.</strong> Confidence level on each data point. Know which contacts are confirmed and which are best-available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Find Owner Information</h2>

        <p>Owner data isn't sitting in a database waiting to be queried. It requires actual research.</p>

        <p><strong>Business registrations.</strong> Secretary of state filings, corporate registrations, DBA filings. These often list the actual owner or registered agent.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional licenses.</strong> Many businesses require owner licensing (contractors, healthcare, financial services). License databases are public records.</p>

        <p><strong>LinkedIn research.</strong> Cross-reference company employees to identify founders, owners, and principals. Verify against other sources.</p>

        <p><strong>Website research.</strong> About pages, team pages, press releases. Many businesses name their owners publicly.</p>

        <p><strong>Email verification.</strong> Once we have a probable email, we verify it actually exists and will deliver before including it.</p>

        <h2>Industries We Cover</h2>

        <p>We can find business owners in any industry. Some have better public data than others:</p>

        <p><strong>High data availability.</strong> Healthcare practices, law firms, accounting firms, real estate agencies, financial advisors. Licensed professionals with public registrations.</p>

        <p><strong>Good data availability.</strong> Restaurants, retail stores, construction companies, auto repair shops. Business registrations plus active local presence.</p>

        <p><strong>Moderate data availability.</strong> Home services, professional services, manufacturing. May require more research but still findable.</p>

        <p><strong>Any industry.</strong> If businesses exist in a category, we can research their owners. Some take more work than others.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Business owner contact information runs $0.25-0.75 per record, depending on industry and data depth. Industries with public licensing data cost less. Industries requiring extensive manual research cost more.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Most lists deliver within 24-48 hours.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>How do you verify owner contacts?</h3>
          <p>Cross-reference business registrations, professional licenses, corporate filings, LinkedIn. Emails get deliverability verification. Ownership confirmed through public records.</p>

          <h3>Owner data vs company data?</h3>
          <p>Company data is generic (info@ email, main phone). Owner data is the actual person: their name, direct email, direct phone. Owner data converts better.</p>

          <h3>Can you provide personal contact info?</h3>
          <p>We provide business contact information. For direct mail, we can provide addresses from business registrations. We don't provide personal cell phones or home addresses from consumer databases.</p>

          <h3>What industries?</h3>
          <p>Any industry. Retail, professional services, healthcare, construction, hospitality, manufacturing. Some have better public data than others.</p>
