        <h2>Who Sells to Real Estate Agents</h2>

        <p>Real estate is a relationship business built on lead generation and client service. Agents invest heavily in tools that help them find, win, and serve clients. Different products reach different segments of the market.</p>

        <p><strong>CRM and technology.</strong> Contact management, transaction management, e-signature, showing software. Top producers invest in technology. The agent or team leader makes these decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing services.</strong> Lead generation, websites, social media, direct mail, advertising. Agents spend heavily on marketing. Individual agents decide for themselves; brokerages sometimes provide tools.</p>

        <p><strong>Photography and media.</strong> Professional photography, video tours, drone footage, virtual staging. Used on almost every listing. Agents choose vendors per listing or establish ongoing relationships.</p>

        <p><strong>Coaching and training.</strong> Business coaching, lead conversion training, mindset programs. Real estate has a strong coaching culture. Top producers and aspiring agents invest in development.</p>
