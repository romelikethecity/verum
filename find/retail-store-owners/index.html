        <h2>Who Sells to Retail Store Owners</h2>

        <p>Retail is brutally competitive. Independent retailers compete against Amazon, big box stores, and direct-to-consumer brands. They're always looking for products to sell, services to improve operations, and technology to compete. Vendors who understand retail challenges win their business.</p>

        <p><strong>Wholesale products.</strong> Manufacturers and distributors looking for retail distribution. Independent retailers are the path to market for many products that can't get into big chains.</p>

        <p><strong>Point of sale and retail technology.</strong> POS systems, inventory management, e-commerce platforms, customer loyalty programs. Small retailers need technology to compete but can't afford enterprise solutions.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Merchant processing, working capital, inventory financing. Retail has thin margins and cash flow challenges. Financial services vendors target retailers heavily.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing.</strong> Local advertising, social media, Google Business optimization, signage. Retailers need foot traffic and online visibility. Marketing vendors help them compete.</p>

        <p><strong>Fixtures and supplies.</strong> Shelving, displays, shopping bags, receipt paper, security systems. Every retail store needs these ongoing supplies.</p>

        <p><strong>Business services.</strong> Insurance, accounting, HR, security. Retail owners need the same professional services as other small business owners.</p>
