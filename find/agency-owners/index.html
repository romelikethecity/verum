        <h2>Who Sells to Agencies</h2>

        <p>Agencies are attractive customers. They buy software, outsource production, need operational support, and influence their clients' purchasing decisions. If you can get to agency owners, you often get multiplied reach.</p>

        <p><strong>Software vendors.</strong> Project management, time tracking, creative tools, analytics platforms, client reporting. Agencies are early adopters and will try new tools.</p>

        <p><strong>White-label services.</strong> SEO fulfillment, paid media management, content production, development, design. Agencies resell these to clients and need reliable partners.</p>

        <p><strong>Business services.</strong> Accounting, HR, legal, insurance. Agency owners need the same professional services as other business owners.</p>

        <p><strong>Media and advertising.</strong> Publishers, ad networks, sponsorship opportunities. Agencies control media budgets and need inventory options.</p>
