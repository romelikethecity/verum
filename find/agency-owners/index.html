      <p class="page-hero__subtitle">Agency owners are everywhere on LinkedIn but almost impossible to reach through their agency's contact form.</p>

<p>Verum finds the actual owners behind marketing agencies, staffing firms, PR shops, and creative studios. We cut through the "schedule a call" forms and generic inboxes to get you direct contact info for the person who signs the checks.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Agencies deliberately hide owner contact info behind intake forms and junior account reps. The owner's name might be on the About page, but their email and phone number definitely aren't. And agency ownership changes constantly through acquisitions and partner buyouts.</p>

<h2>How We Track Down Agency Owners</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Secretary of State filings.</strong> Corporate registration records reveal who actually owns the LLC or Inc., not just who's listed on the website as "founder."</li>
  <li><strong>Industry award and conference mining.</strong> Agency owners show up as speakers, judges, and award winners. These sources give us names that aren't on the website anymore.</li>
  <li><strong>LinkedIn ownership signal detection.</strong> We identify owners versus employees by analyzing title patterns, tenure, and company creation dates on LinkedIn profiles.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-source email discovery.</strong> Once we have the owner's name, we use domain pattern analysis, catch-all detection, and direct verification to find their actual email.</li>
  <li><strong>Phone number verification.</strong> We confirm direct dials and mobile numbers through carrier lookups and real-time verification, not just database pulls.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your Agency Owner List Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Owner name and personal email.</strong> The founder's or managing partner's direct inbox, not the agency's info@ address.</li>
  <li><strong>Agency type and services.</strong> Whether they're a digital marketing shop, PR firm, staffing agency, creative studio, or full-service operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Agency size indicators.</strong> Employee count, office locations, and estimated revenue where available.</li>
  <li><strong>Owner's direct phone number.</strong> Mobile or direct line, verified as active and belonging to the right person.</li>
  <li><strong>Social profiles.</strong> LinkedIn URL and Twitter handle for the owner specifically, not the agency brand accounts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can you find owners of specific types of agencies?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. We can filter by agency type: digital marketing, traditional advertising, PR, staffing/recruiting, creative/design, web development, SEO, social media, and more. We can also filter by the industries they serve or their geographic market.</p>

<h3>How do you handle agencies with multiple partners?</h3>
<p>We identify all partners and flag the managing partner or majority owner. If you want every partner at every agency, we can do that. If you only want the primary decision-maker, we flag who that is based on corporate filings and organizational signals.</p>

<h3>What about agencies that have been acquired?</h3>
<p>We check for recent acquisitions and holding company relationships. If an agency was bought by a larger group last year, we'll flag that and give you the current decision-maker, not the founder who already cashed out.</p>
