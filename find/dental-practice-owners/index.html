        <h2>Why Target Practice Owners Specifically</h2>

        <p>The dental industry has changed. Dental Service Organizations (DSOs) now own a significant portion of practices. Associate dentists working for DSOs don't have purchasing authority. They use whatever the corporate office provides. Independent practice owners, on the other hand, make all the decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Dental equipment.</strong> Chairs, imaging, CAD/CAM, handpieces, sterilization. Practice owners decide what to buy and when to upgrade. Associate dentists work with whatever the practice has.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice management software.</strong> Scheduling, billing, patient communication, imaging management. Practice owners choose the technology stack. They switch systems when something better comes along.</p>

        <p><strong>Dental supplies.</strong> While many supplies are consumables ordered by office managers, practice owners set vendor relationships and approve major supplier agreements.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing and patient acquisition.</strong> Websites, SEO, online reviews, patient retention programs. Practice owners need patients. They invest in marketing to grow their practice.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Practice loans, equipment financing, merchant services, retirement plans. Practice owners have the same financial needs as other small business owners.</p>

        <p><strong>Staffing and HR.</strong> Recruiting hygienists and assistants, HR services, training. Practice owners manage their own teams and deal with the dental hygienist shortage directly.</p>

        <h2>Practice Owner Segments</h2>

        <p><strong>By specialty.</strong> General dentists handle routine care and have the broadest vendor needs. Specialists (orthodontists, oral surgeons, periodontists) have specialty-specific equipment and patient bases.</p>

        <p><strong>By practice size.</strong> Solo practitioners make quick decisions. Group practices with multiple dentists may have partners to consult. Size affects budget and purchasing complexity.</p>

        <p><strong>By geography.</strong> Urban, suburban, rural. Practice economics vary by location. Competition affects marketing needs. Rural practices may face different equipment and supply challenges.</p>

        <p><strong>By practice age.</strong> New practices need everything and are actively buying. Established practices need upgrades and replacements. Dentists approaching retirement are thinking about transitions.</p>

        <p><strong>By services offered.</strong> Some practices focus on bread-and-butter general dentistry. Others add cosmetic, implants, sleep dentistry, or other services that require specific equipment.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
          <h3>Why target owners specifically?</h3>
          <p>Practice owners make business decisions. Associate dentists at DSOs use whatever corporate provides. If you're selling to practices, owners are your buyers.</p>

          <h3>Can you filter out DSOs?</h3>
          <p>Yes. DSO affiliates don't make independent purchasing decisions. We can filter for truly independent practice owners only.</p>

          <h3>General dentists vs specialists?</h3>
          <p>We can filter. General dentists, orthodontists, periodontists, oral surgeons, endodontists, pediatric dentists, prosthodontists. Each has different needs.</p>

          <h3>How do you verify ownership?</h3>
          <p>NPPES data, state dental board records, business registrations, practice websites. We filter out associates and DSO affiliates.</p>
