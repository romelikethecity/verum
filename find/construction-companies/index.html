<p>Verum builds construction company lists that include general contractors, subcontractors, specialty trades, and the specific people at each company who make purchasing decisions. We pull from contractor licensing boards, permit records, and bid databases that generic business directories don't touch.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Construction is one of the hardest industries to build accurate prospect lists for. Companies operate under multiple DBAs, subcontractors change GC relationships constantly, and the person who decides on materials or software is rarely the company owner listed in public records.</p>

<h2>How We Build Construction Company Lists</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State contractor license board data.</strong> Active license records from all 50 states give us verified company names, license classifications, and bonding information that reveal company size.</li>
  <li><strong>Building permit record mining.</strong> Municipal permit databases show us which contractors are actively working, what kinds of projects they take on, and where they operate.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan room and bid database monitoring.</strong> We track who's pulling plans and bidding on projects to identify active GCs and subs in specific markets and project types.</li>
  <li><strong>Trade association and union membership data.</strong> AGC, ABC, NAHB, and local trade association rosters give us specialty classifications and key personnel names.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision-maker identification.</strong> We figure out whether the purchasing decision sits with the owner, a project manager, a superintendent, or a procurement officer at each company.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your Construction Company List Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Company classification.</strong> General contractor, subcontractor, specialty trade, developer, or design-build firm, with specific trade codes (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, concrete, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>License and bonding details.</strong> Active license numbers, classifications, bond amounts, and expiration dates from state licensing boards.</li>
  <li><strong>Key contact information.</strong> Owner, project managers, estimators, and procurement contacts with direct emails and phone numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Project type and size indicators.</strong> Residential, commercial, industrial, or government work. Typical project size based on permit and bid history.</li>
  <li><strong>Geographic service area.</strong> Where they actually work, not just where they're headquartered.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can you find subcontractors in specific trades?</h3>
<p>Yes. We can build lists by trade classification: electrical, plumbing, HVAC, concrete, framing, roofing, painting, flooring, fire protection, and dozens of other specialties. We use state license classification codes to ensure accuracy, not just keyword matching on company names.</p>

<h3>How do you handle companies that work under multiple names?</h3>
<p>Construction companies frequently operate under DBAs or have separate LLCs for different project types. We cross-reference license records, corporate filings, and insurance certificates to link related entities and give you a clean picture of the actual organization.</p>

<h3>Can you identify which contractors are actively bidding on projects?</h3>
<p>We monitor plan rooms and public bid databases to identify contractors who are actively pursuing new work. This is useful if you want to target companies that are growing versus those that are winding down. We can also filter by project type and geography.</p>
