        <h2>Who Sells to Franchise Owners</h2>

        <p>Franchise owners are small business owners with some unique characteristics. They operate within brand frameworks but make many purchasing decisions independently. Different products reach different parts of their operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Payroll and HR services.</strong> Franchises are labor-intensive. Payroll processing, time tracking, HR compliance, benefits administration. The owner handles these, not the franchisor.</p>

        <p><strong>Insurance.</strong> General liability, workers comp, property insurance, commercial auto. Required coverage that franchisees purchase locally.</p>

        <p><strong>Local marketing.</strong> National brands do national advertising, but franchisees often run local campaigns. Digital marketing, direct mail, community sponsorships. The owner or their manager controls this budget.</p>

        <p><strong>Equipment and maintenance.</strong> Beyond what the franchisor requires, there's discretionary equipment spending. HVAC maintenance, cleaning services, security systems. Owners choose local vendors.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Business loans, equipment financing, merchant services beyond brand requirements. Growing franchisees need capital for expansion.</p>

        <p><strong>Technology.</strong> While franchisors mandate some systems, franchisees have flexibility on others. Scheduling software, communication tools, local inventory management.</p>

        <p><strong>Real estate and construction.</strong> Franchisees opening new locations need site selection, build-out contractors, lease negotiation. Multi-unit operators do this repeatedly.</p>

        <h2>Data Fields Available</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Owner information.</strong> Name, direct email, phone. The actual franchisee, not the corporate brand.</li>

          <li><strong>Franchise brand.</strong> Which system they operate. McDonald's, Subway, Great Clips, whatever brand you're targeting.</li>

          <li><strong>Unit count.</strong> Single location vs multi-unit operator. 2-5 units, 5-10, 10-50, 50+. Multi-unit operators are different prospects.</li>

          <li><strong>Location data.</strong> Address, metro area, state. Franchise locations mapped to owner.</li>

          <li><strong>Category.</strong> QSR, casual dining, retail, fitness, automotive, home services, business services, lodging.</li>

          <li><strong>Size indicators.</strong> Estimated revenue, employee count across locations, years as franchisee.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Franchise Segments</h2>

        <p><strong>Single-unit operators.</strong> Own one location. Often hands-on in daily operations. Decisions are quick but budgets are limited.</p>

        <p><strong>Multi-unit operators.</strong> Own multiple locations, sometimes across brands. Have infrastructure (managers, accountants) and larger budgets. These are the high-value targets for most vendors.</p>

        <p><strong>By category.</strong> QSR (quick service restaurants), fast casual, retail, fitness, automotive services, home services, business services, hotels. Different categories have different needs.</p>

        <p><strong>By brand.</strong> Target owners of specific franchises. Useful for brand-specific services or competitive positioning against brand-mandated vendors.</p>

        <p><strong>New vs established.</strong> New franchisees (first 2 years) have different needs than 10-year veterans. New owners need more services; established owners know what works.</p>

        <p><strong>Category.</strong> QSR, retail, fitness, automotive, home services, business services. Or include all categories.</p>

        <p><strong>Unit count.</strong> Single location, 2-5 units, 5-10, 10-50, 50+. Filter for your ideal operator size.</p>

        <p><strong>Established vs new.</strong> Franchisees who've been operating for years vs recent franchise buyers.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <p>Franchise owner lists run $0.30-0.65 per record, depending on data depth and filtering requirements. Basic lists (owner, brand, location) cost less. Full packages with unit counts, multiple locations per owner, and contact verification cost more.</p>

        <p>Minimum project is $500. Most lists deliver within 24-48 hours.</p>
