        <h2>Who Sells to Dental Practices</h2>

        <p>Dental practices buy constantly. Equipment wears out, supplies run low, technology evolves. If you're selling to dentists, you need a way to reach them efficiently.</p>

        <p><strong>Dental equipment and supplies.</strong> Chairs, X-ray machines, handpieces, sterilization equipment. The dentist-owner makes major equipment decisions. Office managers handle supplies.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice management software.</strong> Scheduling, patient records, billing, treatment planning. The dentist or office manager evaluates these. Smaller practices are price-sensitive. Larger groups want integration capabilities.</p>

        <p><strong>Patient communication.</strong> Appointment reminders, recall systems, patient education, review management. Office managers often drive these purchases.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Patient financing, equipment loans, merchant services, practice acquisition lending. Owners need these, especially newer practices still building their patient base.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing services.</strong> Websites, SEO, direct mail, social media management. Dentists know they need marketing. Most don't know where to start.</p>

        <p><strong>HR and staffing.</strong> Dental hygienists, assistants, front office staff. Finding good dental staff is chronically difficult. Staffing agencies target practice owners and office managers.</p>

        <p><strong>Insurance and compliance.</strong> Malpractice coverage, HIPAA compliance, OSHA training. Required purchases that happen on predictable cycles.</p>

        <h2>Data Fields Available</h2>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Practice information.</strong> Name, address, phone, website, years in business, number of operatories.</li>

          <li><strong>Dentist/owner contacts.</strong> Name, credentials (DDS, DMD), direct email, direct phone when available.</li>

          <li><strong>Specialty.</strong> General dentistry, orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, pediatric, prosthodontics, cosmetic focus.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Practice Segments</h2>

        <p><strong>Solo practitioners.</strong> One dentist, often owner-operated. The dentist makes all decisions. Straightforward sales process but lower deal values.</p>

        <p><strong>Group practices.</strong> Multiple dentists sharing space, staff, and overhead. May have dedicated office managers who influence operational purchases.</p>

        <p><strong>DSO-affiliated practices.</strong> Owned or managed by Dental Service Organizations. Local dentists focus on clinical care while DSO handles business operations. Procurement often happens at the DSO level.</p>

        <p><strong>Specialists.</strong> Orthodontists, oral surgeons, periodontists, endodontists. Different equipment needs, different patient flow, different economics than general dentists.</p>

        <p><strong>By geography.</strong> Urban, suburban, rural. Different competitive dynamics and patient demographics.</p>
