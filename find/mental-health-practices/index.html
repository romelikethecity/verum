        <h2>Who Sells to Mental Health Practices</h2>

        <p>Mental health is booming. Demand for services has surged, telehealth has transformed the industry, and practices are struggling to keep up. Vendors who help practices operate more efficiently, reach more patients, or improve outcomes have a receptive audience.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice management software.</strong> EHR, scheduling, billing, telehealth platforms. Mental health practices often use different software than medical practices. The provider or practice owner makes these decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Telehealth platforms.</strong> Video therapy, secure messaging, digital intake. Telehealth went from niche to mainstream. Practices need reliable, HIPAA-compliant platforms.</p>

        <p><strong>Billing and revenue cycle.</strong> Insurance credentialing, claims submission, denial management. Mental health billing is complex. Many practices outsource or use specialized services.</p>

        <p><strong>Patient acquisition.</strong> Online directories, marketing services, referral networks. Practices need patients. Marketing services that understand mental health get traction.</p>

        <p><strong>Continuing education.</strong> CEU courses, training programs, certification courses. Mental health professionals need ongoing education to maintain licenses.</p>

        <p><strong>Office services.</strong> Furniture, supplies, assessment tools, décor. Practice ambiance matters in mental health. Providers invest in comfortable, therapeutic spaces.</p>
