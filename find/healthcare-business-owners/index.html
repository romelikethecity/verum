<p>Verum identifies the actual owners and operators of healthcare businesses, from private practices to urgent care chains to home health agencies. We cut through the corporate structures that obscure who really controls purchasing decisions and vendor relationships.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Healthcare ownership is uniquely opaque. A physician's name might be on the door, but a management company runs the business. Private equity has rolled up thousands of practices under holding companies. And state licensing requirements mean healthcare businesses have more corporate layers than most industries.</p>

<h2>How We Find Healthcare Business Owners</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>NPI and state license correlation.</strong> National Provider Identifiers and state healthcare licensing records help us identify which providers are also practice owners versus employed clinicians.</li>
  <li><strong>Corporate structure analysis.</strong> We trace ownership through management services organizations (MSOs), professional corporations (PCs), and holding companies to find the real decision-maker.</li>
  <li><strong>PE and acquisition tracking.</strong> We monitor private equity acquisitions in healthcare to flag practices that have been rolled up and identify who now controls vendor relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Medicare enrollment data.</strong> CMS enrollment records reveal practice ownership, billing entities, and organizational structures that aren't visible in standard business directories.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-location mapping.</strong> We identify owners who control multiple locations, clinics, or practice sites, revealing their total footprint and purchasing power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your Healthcare Business Owner List Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Owner or operator name.</strong> The person who makes purchasing decisions, whether that's the founding physician, a practice administrator, or a PE portfolio company executive.</li>
  <li><strong>Business type.</strong> Private practice, group practice, urgent care, ambulatory surgery center, home health agency, behavioral health, imaging center, or other healthcare business category.</li>
  <li><strong>Ownership structure.</strong> Independent, PE-owned, hospital-affiliated, or part of a management company. This determines your sales approach.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct contact information.</strong> Personal email and phone number for the owner or decision-maker, not the practice's front desk.</li>
  <li><strong>Location count and NPI details.</strong> Number of sites, provider counts, and NPI numbers for compliance and verification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can you identify which healthcare businesses are PE-owned?</h3>
<p>Yes. We track private equity acquisitions across healthcare verticals.

This matters because PE-owned practices have centralized purchasing.</p>

<h3>What types of healthcare businesses can you find owners for?</h3>
<p>We cover physician practices, dental practices, veterinary clinics, urgent care centers, ambulatory surgery centers, home health agencies, behavioral health practices, physical therapy clinics, imaging centers, pharmacies, and medical device distributors. If it has a healthcare license, we can probably find the owner.</p>

<h3>How do you handle physician-owned practices versus hospital-employed doctors?</h3>
<p>We distinguish between physicians who own their practice and those who are employed by a hospital system or health network. Our lists include ownership verification so you're not wasting outreach on employed physicians who don't have purchasing authority.</p>
