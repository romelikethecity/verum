        <h2>Healthcare Business Types We Cover</h2>

        <p>Healthcare is more than doctor's offices and hospitals. There's a vast ecosystem of healthcare businesses, many of them entrepreneurial operations where owners make all the decisions. Different segments have different needs, but they all need vendors.</p>

        <p><strong>Home health and hospice.</strong> Home health agencies, hospice providers, private duty nursing. Heavily regulated, often owner-operated. Owners deal with staffing challenges, billing complexity, and compliance requirements.</p>

        <p><strong>DME and medical supplies.</strong> Durable medical equipment suppliers. Wheelchairs, oxygen, hospital beds, prosthetics. Retail and service operations with complex billing. Owners manage inventory, delivery, and compliance.</p>

        <p><strong>Labs and diagnostics.</strong> Clinical laboratories, blood draw centers, imaging facilities. Heavy capital investment, technical operations, complex billing. Owners are often pathologists, radiologists, or healthcare entrepreneurs.</p>

        <p><strong>Urgent care and retail health.</strong> Walk-in clinics, occupational health, retail clinics. Growing segment with many independent operators alongside national chains.</p>

        <p><strong>Ambulatory surgery centers.</strong> Outpatient surgical facilities. Often physician-owned, sometimes joint ventures with health systems. High-margin, equipment-intensive operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Behavioral health.</strong> Mental health centers, addiction treatment, psychiatric facilities. Growing demand, staffing challenges, reimbursement complexity. Mix of independent and PE-backed operators.</p>

        <p><strong>Therapy and rehabilitation.</strong> Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy. Often owner-operated practices. Growing demand, labor-intensive operations.</p>

          <li><strong>Business data.</strong> Company name, address, phone, website, NPI, state license numbers.</li>

        <h2>Healthcare Business Segments</h2>

        <p><strong>By business type.</strong> Each healthcare segment has different regulatory requirements, reimbursement models, and vendor needs. Home health is different from DME is different from labs.</p>

        <p><strong>By ownership.</strong> Independent owner-operators make quick decisions. PE-backed businesses have portfolio company processes. Health system affiliates have corporate oversight.</p>

        <p><strong>By size.</strong> Single-location operations vs multi-site operators. Size affects purchasing process, budget, and vendor relationships.</p>

        <p><strong>By geography.</strong> State licensing, payer contracts, and referral networks are often local. Healthcare businesses work defined geographic areas.</p>

        <p><strong>By payer mix.</strong> Medicare-heavy, Medicaid-heavy, commercial-heavy, or cash-pay. Payer mix affects revenue cycle needs and cash flow.</p>
