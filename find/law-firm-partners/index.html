        <h2>Why Target Partners Specifically</h2>

        <p>Law firm partners are the decision-makers. Associates work at the firm; partners own it. When you're selling to law firms, partners approve the purchases, sign the contracts, and allocate the budget. Reaching partners directly cuts through the gatekeepers.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice management and technology.</strong> Case management software, document management, time tracking, billing systems. Managing partners and IT committees evaluate these. Major technology decisions require partner approval.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing and business development.</strong> Websites, SEO, thought leadership, client development coaching. Partners control marketing budgets and strategy. They decide what the firm invests in to attract clients.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional services.</strong> Accounting, HR, recruiting, real estate. Partners make these decisions for the firm. Office managers might implement, but partners approve.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Banking, lines of credit, E&O insurance, retirement plans. Partners are the principals who sign and guarantee. Financial vendors need to reach them directly.</p>

        <p><strong>Legal services vendors.</strong> Research tools, court reporting, process serving, expert witnesses. Partners influence these choices even when associates use the services.</p>
