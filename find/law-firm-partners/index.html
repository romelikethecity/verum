<p>Verum identifies law firm partners and the specific roles they play: managing partner, practice group leader, hiring partner, or of counsel. We deliver direct contact info that gets you past the receptionist and the marketing coordinator who screens vendor emails.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Law firm partner directories are easy to find on firm websites. Getting their direct email address and phone number is the hard part. Most firms route everything through a main number and generic email. Partners at Am Law 100 firms are especially insulated behind layers of staff.</p>

<h2>How We Find Law Firm Partner Contacts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State bar association records.</strong> Active bar membership records confirm partner status, admission dates, practice areas, and disciplinary history across all jurisdictions where they're licensed.</li>
  <li><strong>Firm website and bio scraping.</strong> We pull partner names, practice areas, education, and notable matters from firm websites, then match this against our contact databases.</li>
  <li><strong>Role and authority identification.</strong> We determine whether each partner is a managing partner (budget authority), practice group leader (hiring authority), or equity vs. non-equity partner (investment authority).</li>
  <li><strong>Direct email pattern analysis.</strong> Law firms use predictable email formats. We identify the pattern for each firm and verify individual partner emails through deliverability testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct dial and mobile discovery.</strong> We find direct office extensions and personal mobile numbers that bypass the firm's main switchboard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your Law Firm Partner List Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Partner name and role.</strong> Managing partner, practice group head, hiring partner, equity partner, or of counsel, so you know who to pitch what.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct email and phone.</strong> Verified personal email at the firm domain and direct dial extension or mobile number.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice areas.</strong> Litigation, corporate/M&A, real estate, IP, labor and employment, tax, and other specialties from bar records and firm bio data.</li>
  <li><strong>Bar admissions.</strong> Which states they're admitted in, admission year, and bar number for each jurisdiction.</li>
  <li><strong>Firm details.</strong> Firm name, size tier (Am Law 100/200, midsize, boutique, solo), and office location for that partner.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can you filter law firm partners by practice area?</h3>
<p>Yes. We tag partners by practice area using bar association records and firm bio data. You can filter for litigation partners, corporate/M&A, IP, real estate, labor and employment, tax, healthcare, or any other specialty. This is useful if your product specifically serves one practice area.</p>

<h3>How do you find managing partners versus other partners?</h3>
<p>Managing partners are identified through firm websites, legal directories (Martindale-Hubbell, Chambers), and press releases. We also flag practice group leaders and hiring partners, since each role controls different budgets and decisions.</p>

<h3>Can you build lists of partners at specific firm sizes?</h3>
<p>Yes. We classify firms by size: Am Law 100, Am Law 200, midsize (20-100 attorneys), small (5-20), and boutique/solo. Your selling motion to a BigLaw managing partner is different from a small firm owner, and our lists reflect that.</p>
