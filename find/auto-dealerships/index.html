        <h2>Who Sells to Auto Dealerships</h2>

        <p><strong>F&I products.</strong> Extended warranties, GAP insurance, paint protection, service contracts. The F&I manager is your buyer.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing services.</strong> Digital advertising, website providers, SEO, reputation management, lead generation. Often handled by a marketing manager or GM.</p>

        <p><strong>Fixed operations.</strong> Service equipment, parts suppliers, shop supplies, diagnostic tools. Service and parts managers control these budgets.</p>

        <p><strong>HR and training.</strong> Sales training, compliance training, recruiting services. Dealerships have chronic turnover and always need talent.</p>
