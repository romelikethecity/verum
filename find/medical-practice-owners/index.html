        <h2>Why Target Practice Owners Specifically</h2>

        <p>Not all physicians are the same target. Employed physicians work for hospitals and health systems. They don't make purchasing decisions for their employers. Practice owners, on the other hand, run their own businesses. They decide what to buy, which vendors to use, and how to spend their budget.</p>

        <p><strong>EHR and practice management.</strong> Electronic health records, scheduling, billing, patient communication. Practice owners choose their technology stack. Employed physicians use whatever the hospital gives them.</p>

        <p><strong>Revenue cycle services.</strong> Billing, coding, claims management, credentialing. Practice owners manage their own revenue cycle. They outsource when it makes sense. This is not a decision employed physicians make.</p>

        <p><strong>Clinical equipment.</strong> Diagnostic equipment, exam tables, medical devices. Practice owners decide what equipment to buy and when to upgrade. They control the capital budget.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing and patient acquisition.</strong> Websites, online presence, reputation management. Practice owners need to attract patients. Employed physicians let the health system handle marketing.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Practice loans, equipment financing, merchant services, retirement plans. Practice owners have the same financial needs as other small business owners.</p>

        <p><strong>Staffing and HR.</strong> Recruiting, HR services, training. Practice owners manage their own teams. They hire, fire, and deal with staffing challenges directly.</p>

        <h2>Practice Owner Segments</h2>

        <p><strong>By specialty.</strong> Primary care (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics) vs specialists. Each specialty has different practice economics, different patient volumes, and different vendor needs.</p>

        <p><strong>By practice size.</strong> Solo practitioners make all decisions quickly. Small groups share decisions among partners. Large groups have administrators and formal purchasing processes.</p>

        <p><strong>By geography.</strong> Urban, suburban, rural. Practice economics vary by location. Rural practices face different challenges than urban ones.</p>

        <p><strong>By years in practice.</strong> New practices need everything. Established practices need upgrades and replacements. Exit-planning owners are thinking about transitions.</p>

        <p><strong>By procedure focus.</strong> Procedure-heavy vs cognitive specialties. Procedural practices have different equipment needs and revenue models.</p>
