        <h2>Who Sells to Accounting Firms</h2>

        <p>Accounting firms buy from a specific set of vendors. If you're in one of these categories, you need a way to reach them efficiently.</p>

        <p><strong>Practice management software.</strong> Time tracking, billing, document management. The firms running on spreadsheets are your prospects, but finding them takes research.</p>

        <p><strong>Tax software and research tools.</strong> Beyond the big names, there's always something new. Getting in front of decision-makers during buying season matters.</p>

        <p><strong>IT services and cybersecurity.</strong> CPAs handle sensitive financial data. Security-conscious firms need managed IT, compliance tools, and backup solutions.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing and client development.</strong> Websites, SEO, referral programs. Most firms know they should do more marketing but don't know where to start.</p>

        <p><strong>Staffing and recruiting.</strong> Accounting has chronic talent shortages, especially during tax season. Staffing firms that specialize in accounting professionals need access to hiring managers.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial products.</strong> E&O insurance, retirement plans, merchant services, business loans. Firm owners need the same services as other small business owners.</p>

        <h2>How We Build Accounting Firm Lists</h2>

        <p>We don't just query a database. We actually research and verify.</p>

        <p><strong>Primary sources.</strong> State boards of accountancy (CPA license registrations), AICPA member directories, state CPA society rosters. These are the authoritative sources for who's actually licensed and practicing.</p>

        <p><strong>Business data.</strong> Secretary of state filings, business registrations, professional listings. Helps us identify firm structure and ownership.</p>

        <p><strong>Firm research.</strong> Websites, LinkedIn, industry directories. We find email patterns, direct contacts, practice areas.</p>

        <p><strong>Verification.</strong> Every email gets deliverability verification. Phone numbers validated. Owner names confirmed against firm websites and LinkedIn.</p>
