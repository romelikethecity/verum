<p>Verum builds targeted lists of accounting firms by cross-referencing state CPA board registrations, IRS PTIN databases, and professional association memberships. We don't just find firms. We find the managing partner's direct email and the office manager who actually picks up the phone.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Accounting firms are notoriously hard to prospect because so many operate under generic names or as solo practitioners working from home offices. State board data is public but messy, and firm websites rarely list direct contact info for partners.</p>

<h2>How We Build Accounting Firm Lists</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State CPA board cross-referencing.</strong> We pull active license data from all 50 state boards and match it against firm registrations to build a foundation of verified, practicing CPAs.</li>
  <li><strong>PTIN and EA database matching.</strong> IRS Preparer Tax Identification Numbers and Enrolled Agent records help us identify tax-focused firms that state boards alone might miss.</li>
  <li><strong>Professional association mining.</strong> AICPA, state society memberships, and niche groups like the National Association of Tax Professionals give us specialty tags and seniority signals.</li>
  <li><strong>Firm website scraping for partner names.</strong> We crawl firm websites to pull managing partner names, service lines, and industry specializations that aren't in any directory.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct dial and email verification.</strong> Every contact gets verified through multiple channels so you're not leaving voicemails at a main office number nobody checks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Your Accounting Firm List Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Managing partner name and direct email.</strong> Not the info@ address. The person who makes buying decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Firm size and structure.</strong> Solo practitioner, small firm, regional, or national. Employee count where available.</li>
  <li><strong>Service specializations.</strong> Tax prep, audit, advisory, bookkeeping, forensic accounting, and industry verticals they serve.</li>
  <li><strong>License status and credentials.</strong> Active CPA license, EA designation, and any disciplinary history from state boards.</li>
  <li><strong>Office locations and phone numbers.</strong> Verified physical addresses and direct dials, not just the receptionist line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can you filter accounting firms by specialty or industry focus?</h3>
<p>Yes. We tag firms by their service lines (tax, audit, advisory, bookkeeping) and by the industries they serve (healthcare, real estate, nonprofit, etc.). If you're selling practice management software, we can find firms that still run on spreadsheets. If you sell payroll services, we'll find firms with bookkeeping clients who need that add-on.</p>

<h3>How do you find contact info for solo practitioners?</h3>
<p>Solo CPAs are tricky because they often work from home and use generic email addresses. We cross-reference state license records with PTIN data, LinkedIn profiles, and professional association directories. For solos, we typically deliver a personal email and mobile number rather than a business line that rings to voicemail.</p>

<h3>How current is the accounting firm data?</h3>
<p>Every list is built fresh when you order it. We don't sell pre-built databases. State CPA boards update license status regularly, and we verify emails and phone numbers at the time of delivery. If a firm closed or a partner left, we catch it.</p>
