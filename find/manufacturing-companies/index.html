        <h2>Who Sells to Manufacturers</h2>

        <p>Manufacturing is a massive, diverse sector. Companies that make things need equipment, materials, services, and software. Different products reach different people within manufacturing organizations.</p>

        <p><strong>Industrial equipment and machinery.</strong> CNC machines, assembly equipment, material handling, packaging equipment. Plant managers and operations directors evaluate these. Long sales cycles, large purchases.</p>

        <p><strong>Raw materials and components.</strong> Metals, plastics, chemicals, electronic components. Purchasing managers control these relationships. Volume-based, specification-driven.</p>

        <p><strong>MRO supplies.</strong> Maintenance, repair, and operations supplies. Lubricants, safety equipment, tools, consumables. Purchasing managers and maintenance supervisors buy regularly.</p>

        <p><strong>Software.</strong> ERP, MES, quality management, inventory control, maintenance management. Operations leaders and IT directors evaluate. Implementation is complex.</p>

        <p><strong>Workforce services.</strong> Staffing, training, HR, safety consulting. Manufacturing has labor challenges. HR managers and plant managers need reliable workforce solutions.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial services.</strong> Equipment financing, working capital, insurance. Owners and CFOs handle these decisions.</p>
